  "text": "1 This ageing population is consuming increasing amounts of healthcare resources, with the number of elderly patients admitted to intensive care (ICU) growing progressively. [CITATION_1] In the USA, more than half of all intensive care days are incurred by patients older than 65 yr of age. [CITATION_2][Citation_3] Recent attempts at healthcare cost containment have fuelled discussions on rationing, using age as a discriminator. [CITATION_3] Whether or not rationing based on age becomes explicit, age is already having a negative impact on the decision to admit to ICU. 5 -7 Justification for this is based on the physiological decline and the increase in co-morbidities seen with age. The incorrect assumption from these observations is that the chances of survival from a serious illness in the elderly are unlikely: outcome studies examining this suggest that age is not a good predictor of outcome on ICU. 8 -11 In this study, we sought to identify other factors taken from the first 48 h on ICU which would predict length of stay and mortality in the very elderly.",

      "title": "Intensive care 1980-1995: change in patient characteristics, nursing workload and outcome",
      "abstract": "ObjectiveTo assess temporal changes in patient characteristics, nursing workload and outcome of the patients and to compare the actual amount of available nursing staff with the estimated needs in a medical-surgical ICU.DesignRetrospective analysis of prospectively collected data.SettingA medical-surgical adult intensive care unit (ICU) in a Swiss university hospital.PatientsData of all patients staying in the ICU between January 1980 and December 1995 were included.InterventionsNone.Measurements and resultsThe estimated number of nurses needed was defined according to the Swiss Society of Intensive Care Medicine (SGI) grading system: category I=one nurse/patient/shift (=8 h), category II=one nurse/two patients/shift, category III=one nurse/three patients/shift. An intervention score (IS) was obtained, based on a number of specific activities in the ICU. There was a total of 35,327 patients (32 % medical and 68 % postoperative/trauma patients). Over time, the number of patients per year increased (1980/1995:1,825/2,305, p<0.001) and the length of ICU stay (LOS) decreased (4.1/3.8 days, p<0.013). There was an increase in the number of patients aged >70 years (19 %/28 %,p<0.001), and a decrease in the number of patients<60 years (58 % /41 %, p<0.001). During the same time period, the IS increased two-fold. Measurement of nursing workload showed an increase over time. The number of nursing days per year increased (1980/1995: 7454/8681, p<0.019), as did the relative amount of patients in category I (49 %/71 %, p<0.001), whereas the portion of patients in category II (41 %/28 %,p< 0.019) and category III (10 %/0 %) decreased. During the same time period, mortality at ICU discharge decreased (9.0 %/ 7.0 %,p< 0.002).ConclusionsDuring the last 16 years, there has been a marked increase in workload at this medical-surgical ICU. Despite an increase in the number of severely sick patients (as defined by the nursing grading system) and patient age, ICU mortality and LOS declined from 1980 to 1995. This may be ascribed to improved patient treatment or care. Whether an increasingly liberal discharge policy (transfer to newly opened intermediate care units, transfer of patients expected to die to the ward) or a more rigorous triage (denying admission to patients with a very poor prognosis) are confounding factors cannot be answered by this investigation. The present data provide support for the tenet that there is a trend toward more complex therapies in increasingly older patients in tertiary care ICUs. Calculations for the number or nurses needed in an ICU should take into account the increased turnover of patients and the changing patient characteristics."

      "abstract": "ContextTwo important areas of medicine, care of the critically ill and management ::: of pulmonary disease, are likely to be influenced by the aging of the US population.ObjectiveTo estimate current and future requirements for adult critical care ::: and pulmonary medicine physicians in the United States.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsAnalysis of existing population, patient, and hospital data sets and ::: prospective, nationally representative surveys of intensive care unit (ICU) ::: directors (n = 393) and critical care specialists (intensivists) and pulmonary ::: specialists (pulmonologists) (n = 421), conducted from 1996 to 1999.Main Outcome MeasuresInfluence of patient, physician, regional, hospital, and payer characteristics ::: on current practice patterns; forecasted future supply of and demand for specialist ::: care through 2030.

      "abstract": "A widely held view is that medical costs are a problem verging on a crisis. Perhaps on the principle that drastic problems require drastic solutions, for the first time powerful voices have been raised in favor of explicit rationing as a solution \u2014 possibly the only solution \u2014 to the looming cost crisis. And, in a remarkable reversal of recent history, age has been proposed as a criterion for withholding medical care. This has occurred in a society that less than 30 years ago established Medicare, its first national health plan, specifically to improve the health of the elderly. Although . . ."
