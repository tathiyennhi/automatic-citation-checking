This property is the same as the concept of \"s-rectangularity\" in [CITATION_1] , and is essential for reducing DAMDP to robust MDP in Lemma 1. In addition, [CITATION_2] showed that the robust MDP with coupled uncertainty sets is computationally challenging, which implies solving DAMDP with nonrectangular ambiguity sets is even harder.",

      "title": "Lightning does not strike twice: Robust MDPs with coupled uncertainty",
      "abstract": "We consider Markov decision processes under parameter uncertainty. Previous studies all restrict to the case that uncertainties among different states are uncoupled, which leads to conservative solutions. In contrast, we introduce an intuitive concept, termed \"Lightning Does not Strike Twice,\" to model coupled uncertain parameters. Specifically, we require that the system can deviate from its nominal parameters only a bounded number of times. We give probabilistic guarantees indicating that this model represents real life situations and devise tractable algorithms for computing optimal control policies."

      "title": "Robust Markov decision processes",
      "abstract": "Markov decision processes MDPs are powerful tools for decision making in uncertain dynamic environments. However, the solutions of MDPs are of limited practical use because of their sensitivity to distributional model parameters, which are typically unknown and have to be estimated by the decision maker. To counter the detrimental effects of estimation errors, we consider robust MDPs that offer probabilistic guarantees in view of the unknown parameters. To this end, we assume that an observation history of the MDP is available. Based on this history, we derive a confidence region that contains the unknown parameters with a prespecified probability 1-\u03b2. Afterward, we determine a policy that attains the highest worst-case performance over this confidence region. By construction, this policy achieves or exceeds its worst-case performance with a confidence of at least 1-\u03b2. Our method involves the solution of tractable conic programs of moderate size."
