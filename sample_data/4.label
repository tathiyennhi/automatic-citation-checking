  "text": "Recently, substantial progress has been achieved in understanding the molecular basis of how different subtypes of PRs are specified [CITATION_1] [CITATION_2] ). Initially, R7 and R8 express the transcription factor spalt (sal) that is required to specify them as inner PRs and distinguish them from outer PR identity [CITATION_3] . Then, the expression in R7 of the gene prospero (pros), which encodes a homeodomain transcription factor, further distinguishes R7 from R8 by repressing R8 rhs, rh5, and rh6 .",

      "title": "Flipping coins in the fly retina",
      "abstract": "Color vision in Drosophila melanogaster relies on the presence of two different subtypes of ommatidia: the \"green\" and \"blue.\" These two classes are distributed randomly throughout the retina. The decision of a given ommatidium to take on the \"green\" or \"blue\" fate seems to be based on a stochastic mechanism. Here we compare the stochastic choice of photoreceptors in the fly retina with other known examples of random choices in both sensory and other systems."

      "title": "Building a retinal mosaic: Cell-fate decision in the fly eye",
      "abstract": "Across the animal kingdom, color discrimination is achieved by comparing the outputs of photoreceptor cells (PRs) that have different spectral sensitivities. Much remains to be understood about how the pattern of these different PRs is generated and maintained. The Drosophila eye has long provided a beautiful system for understanding various aspects of retinal-cell differentiation. Recent progress in this field is revealing that a highly ordered series of events, involving cell-cell communication, localized signaling and stochastic choices, creates a complex mosaic of PRs that is reminiscent of the human retina. Notably, several of the factors used in generating the retinal mosaic of the fruitfly have corresponding functions in vertebrates that are likely to have similar roles."

      "title": "Two-step process for photoreceptor formation in Drosophila",
      "abstract": "The formation of photoreceptor cells (PRCs) in Drosophila serves as a paradigm for understanding neuronal determination and differentiation. During larval stages, a precise series of sequential inductive processes leads to the recruitment of eight distinct PRCs (R1\u2013R8). But, final photoreceptor differentiation, including rhabdomere morphogenesis and opsin expression, is completed four days later, during pupal development. It is thought that photoreceptor cell fate is irreversibly established during larval development, when each photoreceptor expresses a particular set of transcriptional regulators and sends its projection to different layers of the optic lobes. Here, we show that the spalt (sal) gene complex encodes two transcription factors that are required late in pupation for photoreceptor differentiation. In the absence of the sal complex, rhabdomere morphology and expression of opsin genes in the inner PRCs R7 and R8 are changed to become identical to those of outer R1\u2013R6 PRCs. However, these cells maintain their normal projections to the medulla part of the optic lobe, and not to the lamina where outer PRCs project. These data indicate that photoreceptor differentiation occurs as a two-step process. First, during larval development, the photoreceptor neurons become committed and send their axonal projections to their targets in the brain. Second, terminal differentiation is executed during pupal development and the photoreceptors adopt their final cellular properties."
