  "text": "Based on the notion that the somatosensory and motor brain representation of the face and the hand are contiguous, double sensations were interpreted as an index of remapping of the face on the de-afferented hand representation. The inherent link between hand and face representations is also supported by studies on healthy subjects in whom complete temporary anaesthesia of the thumb rapidly induced the sensation that the size of the lips increased by up to 50% [CITATION_1] . Neurophysiological evidence for face-hand remapping has been provided by an EEG study documenting that tactile stimulation of the hand activates the cortical representation of the face in people who had undergone cosmetic injections of botulinum toxin to treat wrinkles [CITATION_2] . As previously mentioned, deprivation related neuroplasticity may also be at play after spinal cord lesions. What remains unknown is whether the perceptual correlates of the plasticity found in SCI follows erratic rules [CITATION_3] or may also occur according to somewhat topographic organization.",

      "title": "Massive cortical reorganization after sensory deafferentation in adult macaques",
      "abstract": "After limited sensory deafferentations in adult primates, somatosensory cortical maps reorganize over a distance of 1 to 2 millimeters mediolaterally, that is, in the dimension along which different body parts are represented. This amount of reorganization was considered to be an upper limit imposed by the size of the projection zones of individual thalamocortical axons, which typically also extend a mediolateral distance of 1 to 2 millimeters. However, after extensive long-term deafferentations in adult primates, changes in cortical maps were found to be an order of magnitude greater than those previously described. These results show the need for a reevaluation of both the upper limit of cortical reorganization in adult primates and the mechanisms responsible for it."

      "title": "Perceptual correlates of massive cortical reorganization",
      "abstract": "Following long-term deafferentation of one upper limb in adult primates, the cortical areas corresponding to that limb become responsive to stimuli applied to the face. To explore this phenomenon, we studied some patients after upper limb amputation. In patient VQ, stimuli applied to the lower face or 7 cm above the stump evoked precisely localized referred sensations in individual digits which were often modality specific. Similarly, in another patient, WK several complete somatotopic representations of the phantom limb were found, on the face, chest and axilla, indicating the emergence of such maps in regions remote from the stump. These effects may be a direct perceptual correlate of the physiological observations of Merzenick et al (1984), Wall (1977) and Pons et al (1991)."

      "abstract": "In a left index finger amputee, appropriate stimulation of skin areas of the remnant left fingers or left lower face evoked veridical sensations as well as sensations localized to the phantom finger. Five months after the amputation, there was a systematic correspondence between positions of digital and facial stimuli and positions of stimuli felt on the phantom. More than 3 years after the amputation, orderly maps of the phantom index on the ipsilateral fingers were still detected. By contrast, poorly organized facial maps were present only contralaterally to the amputation. The maps on the remnant fingers are likely to acquire stability because they are systematically activated during manipulations performed with the mutilated hand. The disorganization of facial maps may be related to their irrelevance for behavioral control in everyday life conditions."

      "title": "Phantom lower limb as a perceptual marker of neural plasticity in the mature human brain",
      "abstract": "Three lower limb amputees, who reported phantom sensations, referred somatic stimuli delivered to skin regions proximal to the stump to select points on the phantom limb. Stimuli on the rectum and anus (e.g. during defecation) and on genital areas (e.g. during sexual intercourse) induced analogous, although less precise, mislocation to the phantom limb. Although the representation of the stump in the somatosensory pathway is lateral to that of the amputated lower limb, both anus and genitals are mapped medially to the areas formerly subserving the amputated lower limb. Therefore the mislocalization phenomenon can be considered as a perceptual landmark of new functional connections between the deprived areas and the adjacent ones, thus suggesting a dynamic neural remodelling in the mature nervous system, which was previously considered as a static entity."

      "title": "Anomalous double sensations after damage to the cortical somatosensory representation of the hand in humans",
      "abstract": "Abstract Hand amputees may report that a tactile stimulus delivered to the stump region or the face ipsilateral to the amputation induces the sensation of being touched on the phantom. Given the representational contiguity between hand and face, this phenomenon has been related to electrophysiologically demonstrated orderly remappings occurring in deafferented somatosensory areas. Here we report, for the first time, double sensations evoked by tactile stimuli delivered to the contralesional hypoaesthesic hand in a patient with a lesion involving the hand representation in the primary somatosensory cortex. These double sensations were very precise and consistent over a 4-month period, and were clustered on the contralesional scalp and bilaterally on the nape. The distribution of the referred sensations did not conform to any orderly topographic relationship with the known somatosensory hand representation. Since in our patient the lesion left the nervous pathway from the skin to the thalamus unaffected, th..."

      "title": "Perceptual distortions of the human body image produced by local anaesthesia, pain and cutaneous stimulation",
      "abstract": "To move the tip of the thumb accurately requires knowledge not only of relative muscle lengths and joint angles (for review see McCloskey, 1978; Gandevia, 1996), but also information about the dimensions of body segments. Indeed, without knowledge of the size of body segments, information related to joint angles is unable to specify uniquely the location of an extremity in space. Skill in normal movements, especially those involving the hand, presumably relies on sensory information received by cortical somatosensory areas before and during the movements (Porter & Lemon, 1993). However, in adult non-human primates and other experimental animals, cortical \u2018representations\u2019 of the digits are not fixed but change when amputation or anaesthesia removes the sensory input from them. This adaptation has a rapid phase beginning within minutes (Kelahan & Doetsch, 1984; Calford & Tweedale, 1988, 1991a) and a longer phase developing over weeks and months (e.g. Merzenich et al. 1983, 1984; see also Rasmusson et al. 1992; Zarzecki et al. 1993; for review see Kaas, 1991). Initially, in both flying foxes and monkeys, cells in the primary somatosensory cortex which represent the \u2018lost\u2019 digit respond to a larger area of cutaneous input, including that from more proximal skin and even skin on the adjacent fingers (Calford & Tweedale, 1988, 1991a). Acute changes may also occur at thalamic (Rasmusson et al. 1993) and possibly at cuneate levels (Dostrovsky et al. 1976; Pettit & Schwark, 1993; Northgrave & Rasmusson, 1996). Studies in human subjects have also revealed that the behaviour of the sensorimotor cortex is also not fixed. Human motor cortical \u2018maps\u2019 assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation change acutely with local anaesthesia (Brasil-Neto et al. 1993; Kew et al. 1994). These studies have focused on apparent changes to motor and sensory representations produced by local anaesthesia, nerve section or amputation, but the perceptual implications of the altered sensory inputs have rarely been considered. ::: ::: Some recent studies have indicated the extent to which sensory maps may change under extreme circumstances. When sensory input from the whole arm was removed years previously by an extensive dorsal rhizotomy in monkeys, the cortical representations of the hand and face reorganized over years with the areas usually devoted to the arm map being \u2018invaded\u2019 by inputs derived from the chin (Pons et al. 1991). After long-standing amputation of the hand, some patients sometimes mistakenly localize stimuli on the face to the \u2018phantom\u2019 hand (Ramachandran et al. 1992; Halligan et al. 1993), a phenomenon which has been taken, along with other evidence, to indicate the potential reorganization of the human somatosensory cortex following nerve injury (see Yang et al. 1994; Elbert et al. 1994). However, the subjective responses to stimulation of cutaneous nerve fascicles innervating the hand are preserved after amputation (Schady et al. 1994). ::: ::: The present studies were designed to determine whether perceptual disturbances develop when the afferent input from a body part, usually the thumb, is acutely disturbed. Disturbances included both acute decreases in input produced by local anaesthesia and increases produced by innocuous electrical stimulation or painful cooling of the digits. We devised simple psychophysical techniques (selection by the subject of matching templates of body parts, and drawing by the subject of body parts to depict their size) and showed that the perceived size of a body part can change immediately its sensory input is altered. Some results have been published in abstract form (Gandevia, 1994; Glasby & Gandevia, 1995)"

      "title": "Altered cortical activation from the hand after facial botulinum toxin treatment",
      "abstract": "Plastic interactions between face and hand cortical tactile circuits occur after severe injuries that affect the hand such as in amputation or spinal cord injury. However, whether loss of facial movements alters the cortical circuits involved in processing tactile inputs from the hand remains unknown. In this prospective observational study we used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure cortical activity evoked by tactile stimulation of the hands before and after botulinum toxin-A-induced facial paralysis. We found a reduction in the tactile event-related potentials (ERPs) 6 weeks after the treatment. This suggests that the limited paralysis of facial muscles induced during cosmetic interventions designed to smooth lines and wrinkles on the face is sufficient to alter the cortical processing of tactile inputs from the hand."

      "title": "Referred phantom sensations and cortical reorganization after spinal cord injury in humans",
      "abstract": "To test the hypothesis that cortical remapping supports phantom sensations, we examined referred phantom sensations and cortical activation in humans after spinal-cord injury (SCI) at the thoracic level (T3-T12). Of 12 SCI subjects, 9 reported phantom sensations, and 2 reported referred phantom sensations. In both of these subjects, referred phantom sensations were evoked by contact in reference zones (RZ) that were not adjacent in the periphery and were not predicted to be adjacent in the postcentral gyrus (PoCG), suggesting that representations separated by centimeters of cortical space were simultaneously engaged. This finding was supported by functional MRI (fMRI). In a subject with a T6-level complete SCI, contact in RZ on the left or right forearm projected referred phantom sensations to the ipsilateral chest. During fMRI, contact in either forearm RZ evoked activity in the central PoCG (the position of the forearm representation) and the medial PoCG (the position of the chest representation) with \u22651.6 cm of nonresponsive cortex intervening. In contrast, stimulation in non-RZ forearm and palm regions in this subject and in lesion-matched SCI subjects evoked central but not medial PoCG activation. Our findings support a relation between PoCG activation and the percept of referred phantom sensations. These results, however, present an alternative to somatotopic cortical reorganization, namely, cortical plasticity expressed in coactivation of nonadjacent representations. The observed pattern suggests that somatotopic subcortical remapping, projected to the cortex, can support perceptual and cortical reorganization after deafferentation in humans."

For further explanation of the clarifications and changes in this revision, see the accompanying article (Kirshblum S., et al. J Spinal Cord Med. 2011:doi 10.1179/107902611X13186000420242 ::: ::: The spinal cord is the major conduit through which motor and sensory information travels between the brain and body. The spinal cord contains longitudinally oriented spinal tracts (white matter) surrounding central areas (gray matter) where most spinal neuronal cell bodies are located. The gray matter is organized into segments comprising sensory and motor neurons. Axons from spinal sensory neurons enter and axons from motor neurons leave the spinal cord via segmental nerves or roots. ::: ::: In the cervical spine, there are 8 nerve roots. Cervical roots of C1-C7 are named according to the vertebra above which they exit (i.e. C1 exits above the C1 vertebra, just below the skull and C6 nerve roots pass between the C5 and C6 vertebrae) whereas C8 exists between the C7 and T1 vertebra; as there is no C8 vertebra. The C1 nerve root does not have a sensory component that is tested on the International Standards Examination. ::: ::: The thoracic spine has 12 distinct nerve roots and the lumbar spine consists of 5 distinct nerve roots that are each named accordingly as they exit below the level of the respective vertebrae. The sacrum consists of 5 embryonic sections that have fused into one bony structure with 5 distinct nerve roots that exit via the sacral foramina. The spinal cord itself ends at approximately the L1-2 vertebral level. The distal most part of the spinal cord is called the conus medullaris. The cauda equina is a cluster of paired (right and left) lumbosacral nerve roots that originate in the region of the conus medullaris and travel down through the thecal sac and exit via the intervertebral foramen below their respective vertebral levels. There may be 0, 1, or 2 coccygeal nerves but they do not have a role with the International Standards examination in accordance with the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI). ::: ::: Each root receives sensory information from skin areas called dermatomes. Similarly each root innervates a group of muscles called a myotome. While a dermatome usually represents a discrete and contiguous skin area, most roots innervate more than one muscle, and most muscles are innervated by more than one root. ::: ::: Spinal cord injury (SCI) affects conduction of sensory and motor signals across the site(s) of lesion(s), as well as the autonomic nervous system. By systematically examining the dermatomes and myotomes, as described within this booklet, one can determine the cord segments affected by the SCI. From the International Standards examination several measures of neurological damage are generated, e.g., Sensory and Motor Levels (on right and left sides), NLI, Sensory Scores (Pin Prick and Light Touch), Motor Scores (upper and lower limb), and ZPP. This booklet also describes the ASIA (American Spinal Injury Association) Impairment Scale (AIS) to classify the severity (i.e. completeness) of injury. ::: ::: This booklet begins with basic definitions of common terms used herein. The section that follows describes the recommended International Standards examination, including both sensory and motor components. Subsequent sections cover sensory and motor scores, the AIS classification, and clinical syndromes associated with SCI. For ease of reference, a worksheet (Appendix 1) of the recommended examination is included, with a summary of steps used to classify the injury (Appendix 2). A full-size version for photocopying and use in patient records has been included as an enclosure and may also be downloaded from the ASIA website (www.asia-spinalinjury.org).

      "title": "The Rubber Hand Illusion: feeling of ownership and proprioceptive drift do not go hand in hand",
      "abstract": "In the Rubber Hand Illusion, the feeling of ownership of a rubber hand displaced from a participant's real occluded hand is evoked by synchronously stroking both hands with paintbrushes. A change of perceived finger location towards the rubber hand (proprioceptive drift) has been reported to correlate with this illusion. To measure the time course of proprioceptive drift during the Rubber Hand Illusion, we regularly interrupted stroking (performed by robot arms) to measure perceived finger location. Measurements were made by projecting a probe dot into the field of view (using a semi-transparent mirror) and asking participants if the dot is to the left or to the right of their invisible hand (Experiment 1) or to adjust the position of the dot to that of their invisible hand (Experiment 2). We varied both the measurement frequency (every 10 s, 40 s, 120 s) and the mode of stroking (synchronous, asynchronous, just vision). Surprisingly, with frequent measurements, proprioceptive drift occurs not only in the synchronous stroking condition but also in the two control conditions (asynchronous stroking, just vision). Proprioceptive drift in the synchronous stroking condition is never higher than in the just vision condition. Only continuous exposure to asynchronous stroking prevents proprioceptive drift and thus replicates the differences in drift reported in the literature. By contrast, complementary subjective ratings (questionnaire) show that the feeling of ownership requires synchronous stroking and is not present in the asynchronous stroking condition. Thus, subjective ratings and drift are dissociated. We conclude that different mechanisms of multisensory integration are responsible for proprioceptive drift and the feeling of ownership. Proprioceptive drift relies on visuoproprioceptive integration alone, a process that is inhibited by asynchronous stroking, the most common control condition in Rubber Hand Illusion experiments. This dissociation implies that conclusions about feelings of ownership cannot be drawn from measuring proprioceptive drift alone."

      "title": "How does the human brain deal with a spinal cord injury?",
      "abstract": "The primary sensorimotor cortex of the adult brain is capable of significant reorganization of topographic maps after deafferentation and de-efferentation. Here we show that patients with spinal cord injury exhibit extensive changes in the activation of cortical and subcortical brain areas during hand movements, irrespective of normal (paraplegic) or impaired (tetraplegic patients) hand function. Positron emission tomography ([15O]-H2O-PET) revealed not only an expansion of the cortical 'hand area' towards the cortical 'leg area', but also an enhanced bilateral activation of the thalamus and cerebellum. The areas of the brain which were activated were qualitatively the same in both paraplegic and tetraplegic patients, but differed quantitatively as a function of the level of their spinal cord injury. We postulate that the changes in brain activation following spinal cord injury may reflect an adaptation of hand movement to a new body reference scheme secondary to a reduced and altered spino-thalamic and spino-cerebellar input."

      "title": "Reorganization and preservation of motor control of the brain in spinal cord injury: a systematic review",
      "abstract": "Reorganization of brain function in people with CNS damage has been identified as one of the fundamental mechanisms involved in the recovery of sensorimotor function. Spinal cord injury (SCI) brain mapping studies during motor tasks aim for assessing the reorganization and preservation of brain networks involved in motor control. Revealing the activation of cortical and subcortical brain areas in people with SCI can indicate principal patterns of brain reorganization when the neurotrauma is distal to the brain. This review assessed brain activation after SCI in terms of intensity, volume, and somatotopic localization, as well as preservation of activation during attempted and/or imagined movements. Twenty-five studies meeting the inclusion criteria could be identified in Medline (1980 to January 2008). Relevant characteristics of studies (level of lesion, time after injury, motor task) and mapping techniques varied widely. Changes in brain activation were found in both cortical and subcortical areas of individuals with SCI. In addition, several studies described a shift in the region of brain activation. These patterns appeared to be dynamic and influenced by the level, completeness, and time after injury, as well as extent of clinical recovery. In addition, several aspects of reorganization of brain function following SCI resembled those reported in stroke. This review demonstrates that brain networks involved in different demands of motor control remain responsive even in chronic paralysis. These findings imply that therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring spinal cord function, even in people with chronic SCI, can build on preserved competent brain control."

      "title": "Compensatory changes at the cerebral cortical level after spinal cord injury",
      "abstract": "Neurorehabilitation is based on the concept that rehabilitative training recruits neuronal systems that remain intact after the brain and/or spinal cord injury to take over the impaired function. Understanding the neural mechanism of recovery will surely contribute to the development of evidence-based rehabilitation therapies. Recent studies have shown that after a lesion of the lateral corticospinal tract at midcervical segments, the remaining pathways can compensate for finger dexterity in macaque monkeys in a few weeks to months. Combined brain imaging and reversible pharmacological inactivation of motor cortical regions suggested that the recovery involves the bilateral primary motor cortex during the early recovery stage and more extensive regions of the contralesional primary motor cortex and bilateral premotor cortex during the late stage. Thus, contribution of each cortical region changes depending on the recovery stage, suggesting that the brain uses available pre-existing neural systems by reducing inhibition during the early stage and enhances the original systems or recruits other systems by plastic change of the neural circuits during the late stage. These changes in the activation pattern of motor-related areas represent an adaptive strategy for functional compensation after spinal cord injury."
