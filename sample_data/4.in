      "title": "Building a retinal mosaic: Cell-fate decision in the fly eye",
      "abstract": "Across the animal kingdom, color discrimination is achieved by comparing the outputs of photoreceptor cells (PRs) that have different spectral sensitivities. Much remains to be understood about how the pattern of these different PRs is generated and maintained. The Drosophila eye has long provided a beautiful system for understanding various aspects of retinal-cell differentiation. Recent progress in this field is revealing that a highly ordered series of events, involving cell-cell communication, localized signaling and stochastic choices, creates a complex mosaic of PRs that is reminiscent of the human retina. Notably, several of the factors used in generating the retinal mosaic of the fruitfly have corresponding functions in vertebrates that are likely to have similar roles."

      "title": "Two-step process for photoreceptor formation in Drosophila",
      "abstract": "The formation of photoreceptor cells (PRCs) in Drosophila serves as a paradigm for understanding neuronal determination and differentiation. During larval stages, a precise series of sequential inductive processes leads to the recruitment of eight distinct PRCs (R1\u2013R8). But, final photoreceptor differentiation, including rhabdomere morphogenesis and opsin expression, is completed four days later, during pupal development. It is thought that photoreceptor cell fate is irreversibly established during larval development, when each photoreceptor expresses a particular set of transcriptional regulators and sends its projection to different layers of the optic lobes. Here, we show that the spalt (sal) gene complex encodes two transcription factors that are required late in pupation for photoreceptor differentiation. In the absence of the sal complex, rhabdomere morphology and expression of opsin genes in the inner PRCs R7 and R8 are changed to become identical to those of outer R1\u2013R6 PRCs. However, these cells maintain their normal projections to the medulla part of the optic lobe, and not to the lamina where outer PRCs project. These data indicate that photoreceptor differentiation occurs as a two-step process. First, during larval development, the photoreceptor neurons become committed and send their axonal projections to their targets in the brain. Second, terminal differentiation is executed during pupal development and the photoreceptors adopt their final cellular properties."

      "abstract": "Drosophila colour vision is achieved by R7 and R8 photoreceptor cells present in every ommatidium. The fly retina contains two types of ommatidia, called \u2018pale\u2019 and \u2018yellow\u2019, defined by different rhodopsin pairs expressed in R7 and R8 cells. Similar to the human cone photoreceptors, these ommatidial subtypes are distributed stochastically in the retina. The choice between pale versus yellow ommatidia is made in R7 cells, which then impose their fate onto R8. Here we report that the Drosophila dioxin receptor Spineless is both necessary and sufficient for the formation of the ommatidial mosaic. A short burst of spineless expression at mid-pupation in a large subset of R7 cells precedes rhodopsin expression. In spineless mutants, all R7 and most R8 cells adopt the pale fate, whereas overexpression of spineless is sufficient to induce the yellow R7 fate. Therefore, this study suggests that the entire retinal mosaic required for colour vision is defined by the stochastic expression of a single transcription factor, Spineless."

      "title": "A new rhodopsin in R8 photoreceptors of Drosophila: Evidence for coordinate expression with Rh3 in R7 cells",
      "abstract": "The photoreceptor cells of the Drosophila compound eye are precisely organized in elementary units called ommatidia. The outer (R1-R6) and inner (R7, R8) photoreceptors represent two physiologically distinct systems with two different projection targets in the brain (for review see Hardie, 1985). All cells of the primary system, R1-R6, express the same rhodopsin and are functionally identical. In contrast, the R7 and R8 photoreceptors are different from each other. They occupy anatomically precise positions, with R7 on top of R8. In fact, there are several classes of R7/R8 pairs, which differ morphologically and functionally and are characterized by the expression of one of two R7-specific opsins, rh3 or rh4. Here, we describe the identification of a new opsin gene, rhodopsin 5, expressed in one subclass of R8 cells. Interestingly, this subclass represents R8 cells that are directly underneath the R7 photoreceptors expressing rh3, but are never under those expressing rh4. These results confirm the existence of two subpopulations of R7 and R8 cells, which coordinate the expression of their respective rh genes. Thus, developmental signaling pathways between R7 and R8 lead to the exclusive expression of a single rhodopsin gene per cell and to the coordinate expression of another one in the neighboring cell. Consistent with this, rh5 expression in R8 disappears when R7 cells are absent (in sevenless mutant). We propose a model for the concerted evolution of opsin genes and the elaboration of the architecture of the retina."

      "abstract": "Opsin gene expression in the R7 and R8 photoreceptor cells of the Drosophila compound eye is highly coordinated. We have found that the R8 cell specific Rh5 and Rh6 opsins are expressed in non-overlapping sets of R8 cells, in a precise pairwise fashion with Rh3 and Rh4 in the R7 cells of individual ommatidia. Removal of the R7 cells in sevenless, boss or sina mutants, disrupts Rh5 expression and dramatically increases the number of Rh6-expressing R8 cells. This suggests that the expression of Rh5 may be induced by an Rh3-expressing R7 cell, whereas Rh6 expression is most likely a default state of the R8 cell. We found that the paired expression of opsin genes in the R7 and R8 cells occurs in a sevenless and boss independent manner. Furthermore, we found that the generation of both Rh3- and Rh4-expressing R7 cells can occur in the absence of an R8 cell. These results suggest that the specification of opsin expression in the R7 cells may occur autonomously, whereas the R7 photoreceptor cell may be responsible for regulating a binary developmental switch between induced and default cell-fates in the R8 cell."

      "abstract": "Color vision in Drosophila relies on the comparison between two color-sensitive photoreceptors, R7 and R8. Two types of ommatidia in which R7 and R8 contain different rhodopsins are distributed stochastically in the retina and appear to discriminate short (p-subset) or long wavelengths (y-subset). The choice between p and y fates is made in R7, which then instructs R8 to follow the corresponding fate, thus leading to a tight coupling between rhodopsins expressed in R7 and R8. Here, we show that warts, encoding large tumor suppressor (Lats) and melted encoding a PH-domain protein, play opposite roles in defining the yR 8 or pR8 fates. By interacting antagonistically at the transcriptional level, they form a bistable loop that insures a robust commitment of R8 to a single fate, without allowing ambiguity. This represents an unexpected postmitotic role for genes controlling cell proliferation (warts and its partner hippo and salvador) and cell growth (melted)."

      "abstract": "Comparison between the inputs of photoreceptors with different spectral sensitivities is required for color vision. In Drosophila, this is achieved in each ommatidium by the inner photoreceptors R7 and R8. Two classes of ommatidia are distributed stochastically in the retina: 30% contain UV-Rh3 in R7 and blue-Rh5 in R8, while the remaining 70% contain UV-Rh4 in R7 and green-Rh6 in R8. We show here that the distinction between the rhodopsins expressed in the two classes of ommatidia depends on a series of highly conserved homeodomain binding sites present in the rhodopsin promoters. The homeoprotein Orthodenticle acts through these sites to activate rh3 and rh5 in their specific ommatidial subclass and through the same sites to prevent rh6 expression in outer photoreceptors. Therefore, Otd is a key player in the terminal differentiation of subtypes of photoreceptors by regulating rhodopsin expression, a function reminiscent of the role of one of its mammalian homologs, Crx, in eye development."

      "title": "The control of cell fate in the embryonic visual system by atonal, tailless and EGFR signaling",
      "abstract": "We describe here the role of the transcription factors encoding genes tailless (tll), atonal (ato), sine oculis (so), eyeless (ey) and eyes absent (eya), and EGFR signaling in establishing the Drosophila embryonic visual system. The embryonic visual system consists of the optic lobe primordium, which, during later larval life, develops into the prominent optic lobe neuropiles, and the larval photoreceptor (Bolwig's organ). Both structures derive from a neurectodermal placode in the embryonic head. Expression of tll is normally confined to the optic lobe primordium, whereas ato appears in a subset of Bolwig's organ cells that we call Bolwig's organ founders. Phenotypic analysis, using specific markers for Bolwig's organ and the optic lobe, of tll loss- and gain-of-function mutant embryos reveals that tll functions to drive cells to optic lobe as opposed to Bolwig's organ fate. Similar experiments indicate that ato has the opposite effect, namely driving cells to a Bolwig's organ fate. Since we can show that tll and ato do not regulate each other, we propose a model wherein tll expression restricts the ability of cells to respond to signaling arising from ato-expressing Bolwig's organ pioneers. Our data further suggest that the Bolwig's organ founder cells produce Spitz (the Drosophila TGFalpha homolog) signal, which is passed to the neighboring secondary Bolwig's organ cells where it activates the EGFR signaling cascade and maintains the fate of these secondary cells. The regulators of tll expression in the embryonic visual system remain elusive, as we were unable to find evidence for regulation by the 'early eye genes' so, eya and ey, or by EGFR signaling."

Pacemaker neurons respond to visual system inputs for clock resetting, but, unlike other neurons, have not been reported to transmit rapid signals to their targets. Here we show that pacemaker neurons are required to mediate a rapid behavior. The Drosophila larval visual system, Bolwig's organ (BO), projects to larval pacemaker neurons to entrain their clock. BO also mediates larval photophobic behavior. We found that ablation or electrical silencing of larval pacemaker neurons abolished light avoidance. Thus, circadian pacemaker neurons receive input from BO not only to reset the clock but also to transmit rapid photophobic signals. Furthermore, as clock gene mutations also affect photophobicity, the pacemaker neurons modulate the sensitivity of larvae to light, generating a circadian rhythm in visual sensitivity."

It is expressed and required in photoreceptor cell precursors R1, R3, R4, and R6 during eye development. The absence of svp + function causes a transformation of these cells toward an R7 cell fate, as judged by morphology and expression of an R7-specific marker. This transformation depends in part on the sevenless gene product. Our results show that svp is involved in control of cell fate during the generation of neuronal diversity. Molecular analysis of svp reveals that it is a member of the steroid receptor gene superfamily and is likely to be a Drosophila homolog of the human transcription factor COUP."

      "title": "Interaction between EGFR signaling and DE-cadherin during nervous system morphogenesis",
      "abstract": "Dynamically regulated cell adhesion plays an important role during animal morphogenesis. Here we use the formation of the visual system in Drosophila embryos as a model system to investigate the function of the Drosophila classic cadherin, DE-cadherin, which is encoded by the shotgun (shg) gene. The visual system is derived from the optic placode which normally invaginates from the surface ectoderm of the embryo and gives rise to two separate structures, the larval eye (Bolwig's organ) and the optic lobe. The optic placode dissociates and undergoes apoptotic cell death in the absence of DE-cadherin, whereas overexpression of DE-cadherin results in the failure of optic placode cells to invaginate and of Bolwig's organ precursors to separate from the placode. These findings indicate that dynamically regulated levels of DE-cadherin are essential for normal optic placode development. It was shown previously that overexpression of DE-cadherin can disrupt Wingless signaling through titration of Armadillo out of the cytoplasm to the membrane. However, the observed defects are likely the consequence of altered DE-cadherin mediated adhesion rather than a result of compromising Wingless signaling, as overexpression of a DE-cadherin-alpha-catenin fusion protein, which lacks Armadillo binding sites, causes similar defects as DE-cadherin overexpression. We further studied the genetic interaction between DE-cadherin and the Drosophila EGF receptor homolog, EGFR. If EGFR function is eliminated, optic placode defects resemble those following DE-cadherin overexpression, which suggests that loss of EGFR results in an increased adhesion of optic placode cells. An interaction between EGFR and DE-cadherin is further supported by the finding that expression of a constitutively active EGFR enhances the phenotype of a weak shg mutation, whereas a mutation in rhomboid (rho) (an activator of the EGFR ligand Spitz) partially suppresses the shg mutant phenotype. Finally, EGFR can be co-immunoprecipitated with anti-DE-cadherin and anti-Armadillo antibodies from embryonic protein extracts. We propose that EGFR signaling plays a role in morphogenesis by modulating cell adhesion."

      "title": "Antagonistic relationship between Dpp and EGFR signaling in Drosophila head patterning",
      "abstract": "The Drosophila eye field that gives rise to the visual system and dorsal head epidermis forms an unpaired anlage located in the dorsal head ectoderm. The eye field expresses and requires both Dpp and EGFR signaling for its development. As shown in previous studies, EGFR is required for cell maintenance in the developing visual system. Dpp initially switches on the early eye genes so and eya in the eye field. Consecutively, high levels of Dpp in the dorsal midline inhibit these genes and promote development of head epidermis. We show that Dpp negatively regulates EGFR signaling, thereby increasing the amount of cell death in the dorsal midline. By this mechanism, Dpp controls the formation of a bilateral visual system and indirectly modulates cell death, which is essential for normal head morphogenesis. Loss of either Dpp or its downstream target, Zen, abolishes head epidermis fate and leads to the misexpression of dp-ERK in the dorsal midline. The resulting morphological phenotype consists of cyclopia, reduction of cell death, and failure of head involution. Ectopic expression of activated EGFR inhibits the Dpp target race and thereby causes cyclopia and defective head involution. We discuss possible mechanisms of Dpp and EGFR interaction in the embryo."

This understanding has primarily come from the study of the R7 photoreceptor; much less is known about the development of the other classes of photoreceptor or the nonneuronal cone or pigment cells. I have used a dominant-negative form of the Drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor (DER) to show that this receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) is required for the differentiation of all these cell types, and I have also shown that DER is sufficient to trigger their development. DER is even required in R7, where it can replace Sevenless, another RTK. These results broaden our view of eye development to include the whole ommatidium and suggest that reiterative activation of DER is critical for triggering the differentiation of all cell types."

The optic lobe and Bolwig's organ develop by invagination from the posterior procephalic region. After cells in this region undergo four postblastoderm divisions, a total of approximately 85 cells invaginate. The optic lobe invagination loses contact with the outer surface of the embryo and forms an epithelial vesicle attached to the brain. Bolwig's organ arises from the ventralmost portion of the optic lobe invagination, but does not become incorporated in the optic lobe; instead, its 12 cells remain in the head epidermis until late in embryogenesis when they move in conjunction with head involution to reach their final position alongside the pharynx. Early, before head involution, the cells of Bolwig's organ form a superficial group of 7 cells arranged in a \u2018rosette\u2019 pattern and a deep group of 5 cells. Later, all neurons move out of the surface epithelium. Unlike adult photoreceptors, they do not form rhabdomeres; instead, they produce multiple, branched processes, which presumably carry the photopigment. Notch is essential for two aspects of the early development of the visual system. First, it delimits the number of cells incorporated into Bolwig's organ. Second, it is required for the maintenance of the epithelial character of the optic lobe cells during and after its invagination."

At later stages of embryogenesis, ptc is expressed in the primordia of epithelial placodes of a specific portion of the brain, the optic lobes. Mutant analysis shows that the lack of ptc activity alters the fate of optic-lobe primordia precursors. In ptc mutants they give rise to supernumerary neurons in the larval light-sensory system, termed Bolwig organ, which is derived from precursor cells next to the optic-lobe anlagen. We specifically eliminated ptc protein by chromophore-assisted laser inactivation (CALI) in late wild-type embryos. Such embryos show a normal segment pattern, but they develop phenocopies equivalent to the phenotype of ptc mutant Bolwig organs. Our results demonstrate that the CALI technique can be applied to separate genetic functions at different developmental stages of a living organism and that the segment-polarity gene ptc is redeployed to functionally discriminate between distinct developmental pathways in adjacent pools of precursor cells."

Here, we showed that Bolwig's organ formation and atonal expression are controlled by the concerted function of hedgehog, eyes absent and sine oculis. Bolwig's organ primordium was first detected as a cluster of about 14 Atonal-positive cells at the posterior edge of the ocular segment in embryos and hence, atonal expression may define the region from which a few Atonal-positive founder cells (future primary photoreceptor cells) are generated by lateral specification. In Bolwig's organ development, neural differentiation precedes photoreceptor specification, since Elav, a neuron-specific antigen, whose expression is under the control of atonal, is expressed in virtually all early-Atonal-positive cells prior to the establishment of founder cells. Neither Atonal expression nor Bolwig's organ formation occurred in the absence of hedgehog, eyes absent or sine oculis activity. Genetic and histochemical analyses indicated that (1) responsible Hedgehog signals derive from the ocular segment, (2) Eyes absent and Sine oculis act downstream of or in parallel with Hedgehog signaling and (3) the Hedgehog signaling pathway required for Bolwig's organ development is a new type and lacks Fused kinase and Cubitus interruptus as downstream components."

In response to a polarizing factor, Frizzled signaling specifies R3 and induces Delta, which activates Notch in the neighboring cell, specifying it as R4. Here, we show that the spalt zinc-finger transcription factors (spalt major and spalt-related) are part of the molecular mechanisms regulating R3/R4 specification and planar cell polarity establishment. In mosaic analysis, we find that the spalt genes are specifically required in R3 for the establishment of correct ommatidial polarity. In addition, we show that spalt genes are required for proper localization of Flamingo in the equatorial side of R3 and R4, and for the upregulation of Delta in R3. These requirements are very similar to those of frizzled during R3/R4 specification. We show that spalt genes are required cell-autonomously for the expression of seven-up in R3 and R4, and that seven-up is downstream of spalt genes in the genetic hierarchy of R3/R4 specification. Thus, spalt and seven-up are necessary for the correct interpretation of the Frizzled-mediated polarity signal in R3. Finally, we show that, posterior to row seven, seven-up represses spalt in R3/R4 in order to maintain the R3/R4 identity and to inhibit the transformation of these cells to the R7 cell fate."

Here we report that the rhomboid (rho) gene and the activity of the Drosophila EGF receptor (DER) signaling pathway are necessary to induce specifically three of the eight COPs in an embryonic abdominal hemisegment. The cell-lineage analysis of COPs using the yeast flpase (flp/FRT) method indicated that each of the eight COPs originated from an individual undifferentiated ectodermal cell. The eight COPs in each abdominal hemisegment seemed to be determined by a two-phase induction: first, five COPs are determined by the action of the proneural gene atonal and neurogenic genes. Subsequently, these five COPs start to express the rho gene, and rho activates the DER-signaling pathway in neighboring cells and induces argos expression. Three of these argos-expressing cells differentiate into the three remaining COPs and they prevent neighboring cells from becoming extra COPs."

Unlike sensory bristles, SOPs of chordotonal (stretch receptor) sense organs are tightly clustered. Here we show that for one large adult chordotonal SOP array, clustering results from the progressive accumulation of a large number of SOPs from a persistent proneural cluster. This is achieved by a novel interplay of inductive epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGFR) and competitive Notch signals. EGFR acts in opposition to Notch signalling in two ways: it promotes continuous SOP recruitment despite lateral inhibition, and it attenuates the effect of lateral inhibition on the proneural cluster equivalence group, thus maintaining the persistent proneural cluster. SOP recruitment is reiterative because the inductive signal comes from previously recruited SOPs."

A subset of SOPs are selected by a recruitment pathway involving EGFR signaling to ectodermal cells expressing the proneural gene atonal . We show that EGFR signaling drives recruitment by directly facilitating atonal autoregulation. Pointed, the transcription factor that mediates EGFR signaling, and Atonal protein itself bind cooperatively to adjacent conserved binding sites in an atonal enhancer. Recruitment is therefore contingent on the combined presence of Atonal protein (providing competence) and EGFR signaling (triggering recruitment). Thus, autoregulation is the nodal control point targeted by signaling. This exemplifies a simple and general mechanism for regulating the transition from competence to cell fate commitment whereby a cell signal directly targets the autoregulation of a selector gene."

We have explored the mechanisms that generate this diversity using the Drosophila peripheral nervous system. In this context, Spitz (SPI) ligand can induce two alternative cell fates from the dorsolateral ectoderm: chordotonal sensory organs and non-neural oenocytes. We show that the overall number of both cell types that are induced is controlled by the degree of EGFR signaling. In addition, the spalt (sal) gene is identified as a critical component of the oenocyte/chordotonal fate switch. Genetic and expression analyses indicate that the SAL zinc-finger protein promotes oenocyte formation and supresses chordotonal organ induction by acting both downstream and in parallel to the EGFR. To explain these findings, we propose a prime-and-respond model. Here, sal functions prior to signaling as a necessary but not sufficient component of the oenocyte prepattern that also serves to raise the apparent threshold for induction by SPI. Subsequently, sal-dependent SAL upregulation is triggered as part of the oenocyte-specific EGFR response. Thus, a combination of SAL in the responding nucleus and increased SPI ligand production sets the binary cell-fate switch in favour of oenocytes. Together, these studies help to explain how one generic signaling pathway can trigger the differentiation of two distinct cell types."

The sal gene encodes a zinc finger protein of novel structure composed of three widely spaced 'double zinc finger' motifs of internally conserved sequences and a single zinc finger motif of different sequence. Antibodies produced against the sal protein show that sal is first expressed at the blastoderm stage and later in restricted areas of the embryonic nervous system as well as in the developing trachea. The antibodies detect sal homologous proteins in corresponding spatial and temporal patterns in the embryos of related insect species. Sequence analysis of the sal gene of Drosophila virilis, a species which is phylogenetically separated by approximately 60 million years, suggests that the sal function is conserved during evolution, consistent with its proposed role in head formation during arthropod evolution."

Sequences encompassing this deletion are able to direct expression of the lacZ reporter gene at all stages of the developing visual system, including the photosensitive cells of Bolwig's organ, the ocelli, and the adult eye. The third intron enhancer is the primary regulatory element controlling otd in the R cells and is not under the control of the glass gene."

      "title": "Development of neural lineages derived from the sine oculis positive eye field of Drosophila",
      "abstract": "The Anlage of the Drosophila visual system, called eye field, comprises a domain in the dorso-medial neurectoderm of the embryonic head and is defined by the expression of the early eye gene sine oculis (so). Beside the eye and optic lobe, the eye field gives rise to several neuroblasts that contribute their lineages to the central brain. Since so expression is only very short lived, the later development of these neuroblasts has so far been elusive. Using the P-element replacement technique [Genetics, 151 (1999) 1093] we generated a so-Gal4 line driving the reporter gene LacZ that perdures in the eye field derived cells throughout embryogenesis and into the larval period. This allowed us to reconstruct the morphogenetic movements of the eye field derived lineages, as well as the projection pattern of their neurons. The eye field produces a dorsal (Pc1/2) and a ventral (Pp3) group of three to four neuroblasts each. In addition, the target neurons of the larval eye, the optic lobe pioneers (OLPs) are derived from the eye field. The embryonically born (primary) neurons of the Pp3 lineages spread out at the inner surface of the optic lobe. Together with the OLPs, their axons project to the dorsal neuropile of the protocerebrum. Pp3 neuroblasts reassume expression of so-Gal4 in the larval period and produce secondary neurons whose axonal projection coincides with the pattern formed by the primary Pp3 neurons. Several other small clusters of neurons that originate from outside the eye field, but have axonal connections to the dorsal protocerebrum, also express so and are labeled by so-Gal4 driven LacZ. We discuss the dynamic pattern of the so-positive lineages as a tool to reconstruct the morphogenesis of the larval brain."

      "title": "Functional analysis of CNK in RAS signaling",
      "abstract": "Connector enhancer of KSR (CNK) is a multidomain protein required for RAS signaling. Its C-terminal portion (CNKC-term) directly binds to RAF. Herein, we show that the N-terminal portion of CNK (CNKN-term) strongly cooperates with RAS, whereas CNKC-term efficiently blocks RAS- and RAF-dependent signaling when overexpressed in the Drosophila eye. Two effector loop mutants of RASV12, S35 and C40, which selectively activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase pathways, respectively, do not cooperate with CNK. However, a strong cooperation is observed between CNK and RASV12G37, an effector loop mutant known in mammals to activate specifically the RAL pathway. We have identified two domains in CNKN-term that are critical for cooperation with RAS. Our results suggest that CNK functions in more than one pathway downstream of RAS. CNKc-term seems to regulate RAF, a component of the MAPK pathway, whereas CNKN-term seems to be involved in a MAPK-independent pathway."

      "title": "Dual function of the regionspecific homeotic gene spalt during Drosophila tracheal system development",
      "abstract": "We report that the region-specific homeotic gene spalt affects the Drosophila tracheal system at two different stages of embryonic development. Both lack-of-function and gain-of-function experiments show that blastodermal spalt activity restricts tracheal development to 10 bilaterally positioned pairs of tracheal placodes in the trunk region by repressing placode formation in parasegments 2, 3 and 14. The results suggest that the activity of the zinc-finger type transcription factor encoded by spalt suppresses the molecular pathway that establishes tracheal development. spalt function is also necessary for the directed migration of the dorsal trunk cells, a distinct subset of tracheal cells. This process is a prerequisite for the formation of the dorsal trunk generated by fusion of adjacent tracheal metameres into a common tubular structure. The directed cell migration, in which spalt gene function participates, seems to be independent of branch fusion and general tracheal cell migration processes."

      "title": "Cell fate control in the Drosophila retina by the orphan receptor seven-up: Its role in the decisions mediated by the ras signaling pathway",
      "abstract": "Drosophila seven-up is an orphan receptor of the steroid receptor family that is required to specify photoreceptor neuron subtypes in the developing compound eye. Expression of seven-up is confined to four of the eight photoreceptor precursors, R3/R4/R1/R6. We show that misexpression of seven-up in any of the other cell types within the developing ommatidium interferes with their differentiation. Each cell type responds differently to seven-up misexpression. For example, ectopic expression in the non-neuronal cone cells using the sevenless promoter/enhancer (sev-svp) causes the cone cells to take on a neuronal identity. Ectopic expression of seven-up in R2/R5 using the rough enhancer (ro-svp) causes these neurons to lose aspects of their photoreceptor subtype identity while remaining neuronal. Each cell type appears to have a different developmental time window that is sensitive to misexpressed seven-up. The temporal order of responsiveness of each cell type to misexpressed seven-up is similar but not identical to the order of neuronal differentiation. This suggests that there are processes of specification that are distinct from the specification to become a photoreceptor neuron. We have identified members of the ras signaling pathway as suppressors of the cone cell to R7 neuron transformation caused by sev-svp. Suppression of the sev-svp phenotype can be achieved by decreasing the gene-dosage of any of the members of the ras-pathway. This suggests that the function of seven-up in the cone cells requires ras signaling. However, a decrease in ras signaling results in enhancement of the phenotype caused by the ro-svp transgene. We discuss the relationship between decisions controlled by seven-up and those controlled by ras signaling."

      "title": "The columnar gene vnd is required for tritocerebral neuromere formation during embryonic brain development of Drosophila",
      "abstract": "In Drosophila, evolutionarily conserved transcription factors are required for the specification of neural lineages along the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes, such as Hox genes for anteroposterior and columnar genes for dorsoventral patterning. In this report, we analyse the role of the columnar patterning gene ventral nervous system defective (vnd) in embryonic brain development. Expression of vnd is observed in specific subsets of cells in all brain neuromeres. Loss-of-function analysis focussed on the tritocerebrum shows that inactivation of vnd results in regionalized axonal patterning defects, which are comparable with the brain phenotype caused by mutation of the Hox gene labial (lab). However, in contrast to lab activity in specifying tritocerebral neuronal identity, vnd is required for the formation and specification of tritocerebral neural lineages. Thus, in early vnd mutant embryos, the Tv1-Tv5 neuroblasts, which normally express lab, do not form. Later in embryogenesis, vnd mutants show an extensive loss of lab-expressing cells because of increased apoptotic activity, resulting in a gap-like brain phenotype that is characterized by an almost complete absence of the tritocerebral neuromere. Correspondingly, genetic block of apoptosis in vnd mutant embryos partially restores tritocerebral cells as well as axon tracts. Taken together, our results indicate that vnd is required for the genesis and proper identity specification of tritocerebral neural lineages during embryonic brain development of Drosophila."
