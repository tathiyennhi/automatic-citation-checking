In  the state-wise ambiguity set is restricted to the following form:C s = {\u03bc s |\u03bc s (O i s ) \u2265 \u03b1 i s \u2200 i = 1, . . . , n s }, where \u03b1 i s \u2264 \u03b1 j s and O i s is a proper set of uncertain parameters with a \"nested-set\" structure, i.e., satisfying O i s \u2286 O j s , for all i < j [see Fig. 1(a) ]. This setup can effectively model distributions with a single mode (such as a Gaussian distribution), but less so when modeling multi-mode distributions such as a mixture Gaussian distribution. Moreover, other probabilistic information such as mean, variance etc. cannot be incorporated. Thus, in this technical note, we extend the distributionally robust MDP approach to handle ambiguity sets with more general structures. In particular, we consider a class of ambiguity sets, first proposed in  as a unifying framework for modeling and solving distributionally robust single-stage optimization problems, and embed them into the distributionally robust MDPs setup. These ambiguity sets are considerably more general: they are characterized by a class of O i s which can either be nested or disjoint [as shown in Fig. 1(b) ], and moreover, additional linear constraints are allowed to define the ambiguity set, which can be used to incorporate probabilistic information such as mean, covariance or other variation measures. We show that, under this more general class of ambiguity sets, the resulting distributionally robust MDPs remain tractable under mild technical conditions, and often outperform previous methods thanks to the fact that it can model uncertainty in a more flexible way.",

      "abstract": "Distributionally robust optimization is a paradigm for decision making under uncertainty where the uncertain problem data are governed by a probability distribution that is itself subject to uncertainty. The distribution is then assumed to belong to an ambiguity set comprising all distributions that are compatible with the decision maker's prior information. In this paper, we propose a unifying framework for modeling and solving distributionally robust optimization problems. We introduce standardized ambiguity sets that contain all distributions with prescribed conic representable confidence sets and with mean values residing on an affine manifold. These ambiguity sets are highly expressive and encompass many ambiguity sets from the recent literature as special cases. They also allow us to characterize distributional families in terms of several classical and/or robust statistical indicators that have not yet been studied in the context of robust optimization. We determine conditions under which distributionally robust optimization problems based on our standardized ambiguity sets are computationally tractable. We also provide tractable conservative approximations for problems that violate these conditions."

      "title": "Distributionally robust Markov decision processes",
      "abstract": "We consider Markov decision processes where the values of the parameters are uncertain. This uncertainty is described by a sequence of nested sets (that is, each set contains the previous one), each of which corresponds to a probabilistic guarantee for a different confidence level so that a set of admissible probability distributions of the unknown parameters is specified. This formulation models the case where the decision maker is aware of and wants to exploit some (yet imprecise) a-priori information of the distribution of parameters, and arises naturally in practice where methods to estimate the confidence region of parameters abound. We propose a decision criterion based on distributional robustness: the optimal policy maximizes the expected total reward under the most adversarial probability distribution over realizations of the uncertain parameters that is admissible (i.e., it agrees with the a-priori information). We show that finding the optimal distributionally robust policy can be reduced to a standard robust MDP where the parameters belong to a single uncertainty set, hence it can be computed in polynomial time under mild technical conditions."
