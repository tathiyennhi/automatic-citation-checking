  "text": "Based on the notion that the somatosensory and motor brain representation of the face and the hand are contiguous, double sensations were interpreted as an index of remapping of the face on the de-afferented hand representation. The inherent link between hand and face representations is also supported by studies on healthy subjects in whom complete temporary anaesthesia of the thumb rapidly induced the sensation that the size of the lips increased by up to 50% [CITATION_1] . Neurophysiological evidence for face-hand remapping has been provided by an EEG study documenting that tactile stimulation of the hand activates the cortical representation of the face in people who had undergone cosmetic injections of botulinum toxin to treat wrinkles [CITATION_2] . As previously mentioned, deprivation related neuroplasticity may also be at play after spinal cord lesions. What remains unknown is whether the perceptual correlates of the plasticity found in SCI follows erratic rules [CITATION_3] or may also occur according to somewhat topographic organization.",

      "title": "Altered cortical activation from the hand after facial botulinum toxin treatment",
      "abstract": "Plastic interactions between face and hand cortical tactile circuits occur after severe injuries that affect the hand such as in amputation or spinal cord injury. However, whether loss of facial movements alters the cortical circuits involved in processing tactile inputs from the hand remains unknown. In this prospective observational study we used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure cortical activity evoked by tactile stimulation of the hands before and after botulinum toxin-A-induced facial paralysis. We found a reduction in the tactile event-related potentials (ERPs) 6 weeks after the treatment. This suggests that the limited paralysis of facial muscles induced during cosmetic interventions designed to smooth lines and wrinkles on the face is sufficient to alter the cortical processing of tactile inputs from the hand."

      "title": "Referred phantom sensations and cortical reorganization after spinal cord injury in humans",
      "abstract": "To test the hypothesis that cortical remapping supports phantom sensations, we examined referred phantom sensations and cortical activation in humans after spinal-cord injury (SCI) at the thoracic level (T3-T12). Of 12 SCI subjects, 9 reported phantom sensations, and 2 reported referred phantom sensations. In both of these subjects, referred phantom sensations were evoked by contact in reference zones (RZ) that were not adjacent in the periphery and were not predicted to be adjacent in the postcentral gyrus (PoCG), suggesting that representations separated by centimeters of cortical space were simultaneously engaged. This finding was supported by functional MRI (fMRI). In a subject with a T6-level complete SCI, contact in RZ on the left or right forearm projected referred phantom sensations to the ipsilateral chest. During fMRI, contact in either forearm RZ evoked activity in the central PoCG (the position of the forearm representation) and the medial PoCG (the position of the chest representation) with \u22651.6 cm of nonresponsive cortex intervening. In contrast, stimulation in non-RZ forearm and palm regions in this subject and in lesion-matched SCI subjects evoked central but not medial PoCG activation. Our findings support a relation between PoCG activation and the percept of referred phantom sensations. These results, however, present an alternative to somatotopic cortical reorganization, namely, cortical plasticity expressed in coactivation of nonadjacent representations. The observed pattern suggests that somatotopic subcortical remapping, projected to the cortex, can support perceptual and cortical reorganization after deafferentation in humans."

      "title": "Perceptual distortions of the human body image produced by local anaesthesia, pain and cutaneous stimulation",
      "abstract": "To move the tip of the thumb accurately requires knowledge not only of relative muscle lengths and joint angles (for review see McCloskey, 1978; Gandevia, 1996), but also information about the dimensions of body segments. Indeed, without knowledge of the size of body segments, information related to joint angles is unable to specify uniquely the location of an extremity in space. Skill in normal movements, especially those involving the hand, presumably relies on sensory information received by cortical somatosensory areas before and during the movements (Porter & Lemon, 1993). However, in adult non-human primates and other experimental animals, cortical \u2018representations\u2019 of the digits are not fixed but change when amputation or anaesthesia removes the sensory input from them. This adaptation has a rapid phase beginning within minutes (Kelahan & Doetsch, 1984; Calford & Tweedale, 1988, 1991a) and a longer phase developing over weeks and months (e.g. Merzenich et al. 1983, 1984; see also Rasmusson et al. 1992; Zarzecki et al. 1993; for review see Kaas, 1991). Initially, in both flying foxes and monkeys, cells in the primary somatosensory cortex which represent the \u2018lost\u2019 digit respond to a larger area of cutaneous input, including that from more proximal skin and even skin on the adjacent fingers (Calford & Tweedale, 1988, 1991a). Acute changes may also occur at thalamic (Rasmusson et al. 1993) and possibly at cuneate levels (Dostrovsky et al. 1976; Pettit & Schwark, 1993; Northgrave & Rasmusson, 1996). Studies in human subjects have also revealed that the behaviour of the sensorimotor cortex is also not fixed. Human motor cortical \u2018maps\u2019 assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation change acutely with local anaesthesia (Brasil-Neto et al. 1993; Kew et al. 1994). These studies have focused on apparent changes to motor and sensory representations produced by local anaesthesia, nerve section or amputation, but the perceptual implications of the altered sensory inputs have rarely been considered. ::: ::: Some recent studies have indicated the extent to which sensory maps may change under extreme circumstances. When sensory input from the whole arm was removed years previously by an extensive dorsal rhizotomy in monkeys, the cortical representations of the hand and face reorganized over years with the areas usually devoted to the arm map being \u2018invaded\u2019 by inputs derived from the chin (Pons et al. 1991). After long-standing amputation of the hand, some patients sometimes mistakenly localize stimuli on the face to the \u2018phantom\u2019 hand (Ramachandran et al. 1992; Halligan et al. 1993), a phenomenon which has been taken, along with other evidence, to indicate the potential reorganization of the human somatosensory cortex following nerve injury (see Yang et al. 1994; Elbert et al. 1994). However, the subjective responses to stimulation of cutaneous nerve fascicles innervating the hand are preserved after amputation (Schady et al. 1994). ::: ::: The present studies were designed to determine whether perceptual disturbances develop when the afferent input from a body part, usually the thumb, is acutely disturbed. Disturbances included both acute decreases in input produced by local anaesthesia and increases produced by innocuous electrical stimulation or painful cooling of the digits. We devised simple psychophysical techniques (selection by the subject of matching templates of body parts, and drawing by the subject of body parts to depict their size) and showed that the perceived size of a body part can change immediately its sensory input is altered. Some results have been published in abstract form (Gandevia, 1994; Glasby & Gandevia, 1995)"
