      "title": "Intensive care 1980-1995: change in patient characteristics, nursing workload and outcome",
      "abstract": "ObjectiveTo assess temporal changes in patient characteristics, nursing workload and outcome of the patients and to compare the actual amount of available nursing staff with the estimated needs in a medical-surgical ICU.DesignRetrospective analysis of prospectively collected data.SettingA medical-surgical adult intensive care unit (ICU) in a Swiss university hospital.PatientsData of all patients staying in the ICU between January 1980 and December 1995 were included.InterventionsNone.Measurements and resultsThe estimated number of nurses needed was defined according to the Swiss Society of Intensive Care Medicine (SGI) grading system: category I=one nurse/patient/shift (=8 h), category II=one nurse/two patients/shift, category III=one nurse/three patients/shift. An intervention score (IS) was obtained, based on a number of specific activities in the ICU. There was a total of 35,327 patients (32 % medical and 68 % postoperative/trauma patients). Over time, the number of patients per year increased (1980/1995:1,825/2,305, p<0.001) and the length of ICU stay (LOS) decreased (4.1/3.8 days, p<0.013). There was an increase in the number of patients aged >70 years (19 %/28 %,p<0.001), and a decrease in the number of patients<60 years (58 % /41 %, p<0.001). During the same time period, the IS increased two-fold. Measurement of nursing workload showed an increase over time. The number of nursing days per year increased (1980/1995: 7454/8681, p<0.019), as did the relative amount of patients in category I (49 %/71 %, p<0.001), whereas the portion of patients in category II (41 %/28 %,p< 0.019) and category III (10 %/0 %) decreased. During the same time period, mortality at ICU discharge decreased (9.0 %/ 7.0 %,p< 0.002).ConclusionsDuring the last 16 years, there has been a marked increase in workload at this medical-surgical ICU. Despite an increase in the number of severely sick patients (as defined by the nursing grading system) and patient age, ICU mortality and LOS declined from 1980 to 1995. This may be ascribed to improved patient treatment or care. Whether an increasingly liberal discharge policy (transfer to newly opened intermediate care units, transfer of patients expected to die to the ward) or a more rigorous triage (denying admission to patients with a very poor prognosis) are confounding factors cannot be answered by this investigation. The present data provide support for the tenet that there is a trend toward more complex therapies in increasingly older patients in tertiary care ICUs. Calculations for the number or nurses needed in an ICU should take into account the increased turnover of patients and the changing patient characteristics."

Perhaps on the principle that drastic problems require drastic solutions, for the first time powerful voices have been raised in favor of explicit rationing as a solution \u2014 possibly the only solution \u2014 to the looming cost crisis. And, in a remarkable reversal of recent history, age has been proposed as a criterion for withholding medical care.

      "title": "Nosocomial infections and outcome of critically ill elderly patients after surgery",
      "abstract": "Background: The relation between older age and nosocomial infection and mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) is still a controversial issue. Methods: The authors prospectively studied 406 patients admitted to a surgical ICU, 106 of whom were more than 75 yr old. Information concerning ICU-acquired nosocomial infections, severity of illness, therapeutic activity, and hospital outcome was collected. A Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to evaluate potential risk factors for ICU-acquired nosocomial infections, ICU, and hospital death. Results: During their ICU stay, 23 elderly patients experienced 40 nosocomial infections, 28 young patients ( < 60 yr) experienced 54 nosocomial infections, and 52 intermediate age patients (60-75 yr) experienced 98 nosocomial infections. Incidence density of nosocomial infections was 4.9% patient days for elderly patients, 4.7% for young patients, and 6.0% for intermediate age patients (no significance). The frequency distribution of the various microorganisms isolated was similar between the three groups. Compared with younger patients, elderly patients had a higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score and a higher ICU and hospital mortality rate. Despite a higher level of severity of illness, elderly patients had a reduction of therapeutic activity. However, Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that age more than 75 yr was not a risk factor for ICU-acquired nosocomial infection, ICU, or hospital death. Conclusions: In patients referred to a surgical ICU after a surgical procedure, age more than 75 yr by itself does not appear to be a significant predictor of ICU-acquired nosocomial infection or mortality rate during the ICU stay. However, it appears that patients more than 60 yr have a higher incidence of nosocomial infection in ICU."

      "title": "Quality of life and functional level in elderly patients surviving surgical intensive care",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND ::: The elderly consume up to one third of health care resources and have become a target for cost reduction efforts. This study was performed to evaluate elderly survivors of surgical critical illness using perceived quality of life and activities of daily living as indicators of value of care. ::: ::: ::: STUDY DESIGN ::: Six hundred seventy-two patients age 70 years and older admitted to a surgical intensive care unit between October 1, 1992 and March 31, 1995 were studied. Intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, admission type and service, and severity of illness were integrated with preadmission and current activities of daily living in survivors. Perceived quality of life was assessed where obtainable from patient or direct proxy. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Activities of daily living were obtained on 342 (50.9%) and perceived quality of life evaluations on 240 (35.7%) of the initial study population. Median duration from admission to evaluation was 21 months. Activities of daily living scores decreased significantly overall from 4.75+/-0.72 (mean; +/- standard deviation) to 4.22+/-1.41, the proportion of completely independent patients fell from 84.9% to 72.0%, and the number of completely dependent patients rose from 0% to 3.8%. Perceived quality of life scores were not significantly different than scores in healthy patients living in the community. Using regression models, age, service, APACHE II score, and emergent operation or admission did not demonstrate relationships to changes in activities of daily living scores. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Although overall functional levels fell, rates of full dependency rose only slightly and perceived quality of life was high in a group of elderly patients surviving surgical intensive care. High hospital and postdischarge mortality should not motivate restriction of care for elderly patients requiring surgical intensive care given their high postillness subjective quality of life measures."

      "title": "Determinants of outcome in elderly patients admitted to the intensive care unit",
      "abstract": "Background: age is thought to be strongly associated with intensive care outcomes, but this relationship may be confounded by many clinical variables. Objectives: to compare clinical characteristics of elderly patients (\u2265 65 years) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with those in younger patients and to identify the risk factors which independently could predict mortality in patients aged \u2265 75 years. Design: prospective observational cohort study. Setting: medical-surgical ICU in a university hospital. Subjects: 2,067 adult patients admitted to the ICU. Methods: comparison of clinical characteristics of patients divided into groups according to their age. Results: elderly patients comprised 51% of the study population. Compared with younger patients, elderly patients were more severely ill on admission, had shock and renal dysfunction. The presence of infection on admission and the incidence rate of infection acquired during stay in the ICU also significantly increased with age. Hospital mortality increased with age: for patients aged \u2265 75 years, it was more than double that of patients aged < 65 years (39% versus 19%, P < 0.001). Using multivariate logistic regression analysis we determined the independent risk factors of hospital mortality for the patients aged \u2265 75 years: impaired level of consciousness, infection on admission, ICU-acquired infection and severity of illness score. Conclusions: morbidity and mortality in elderly patients admitted to the ICU are higher than in younger patients. The most important factors independently associated with the highest risk of death are the severity of illness, impaired level of consciousness and infection."
