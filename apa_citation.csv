"The analysis of acknowledgments is particularly interesting as acknowledgments may 
give an insight into aspects of the scientific community, such as reward systems (Dzieżyc 
& Kazienko, 2022), collaboration patterns, and hidden research trends (Giles & Councill, 
2004; Diaz-Faes & Bordons, 2017).","reward systems Dzieżyc Kazienko collaboration patterns hidden research trends (Giles & Councill,
