Introduction
Acknowledgments in scientific papers are short texts where the author(s) “identify those 
who made special intellectual or technical contribution to a study that are not sufficient 
to qualify them for authorship” (Kassirer & Angell, 1991, p. 1511).","Unter Sachsenhausen, 1991, p. 1511",Unter Sachsenhausen,1991,"“identify those
