<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Citations have long served as a foundational element of academic work, ensuring the attribution of ideas, supporting claims, and providing a mechanism for verifying the authenticity of scholarly content. The role of citations extends beyond mere acknowledgment, functioning as a network that interlinks various strands of research across disciplines, thereby enabling the academic community to trace the evolution of ideas and the lineage of knowledge. The practice of citation is integral to the academic endeavour, fostering a culture of intellectual honesty and scholarly rigor. However, the manual process of generating accurate citations is both time-consuming and prone to human error, often resulting in inconsistencies that can undermine the credibility of academic writing. This challenge is further exacerbated by the diversity of citation styles and the need for precision in adhering to the specific requirements of each. Consequently, the automation of citation generation has emerged as a crucial area of research, aiming to streamline the citation process while maintaining the high standards expected in scholarly communication.</p><p>The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced new possibilities for automating the generation of citations, leveraging the vast amounts of textual data these models have been trained on. LLMs, with their advanced natural language processing capabilities, offer the potential to analyze and replicate the complex patterns of citation practices observed in academic literature. However, while existing models have made strides in automating citation generation, they often lack the granularity needed to accurately replicate the subtle variations in citation usage across different contexts. The challenge lies in developing models that can not only generate citations but also discern the appropriate level of granularity, ensuring that citations are both contextually relevant and sufficiently detailed. This study addresses this challenge by focusing on the development of fine-grained superficial citations within Mistral, an open-source LLM. The aim is to enhance the model's ability to generate citations that reflect the nuanced citation practices observed in academic writing, thereby improving the overall quality and reliability of automated citation generation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Background</head><p>Citations have historically been a critical component of scholarly communication, serving multiple purposes such as giving credit to original authors, providing evidence for claims, and enabling readers to verify sources. Over time, the conventions surrounding citation practices have evolved, with different academic disciplines adopting distinct styles and norms. Despite these variations, the underlying principles of citation remain consistent, emphasizing the importance of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to established guidelines. However, the process of citation generation is not without its challenges. Authors are required to meticulously follow specific formatting rules, which vary significantly depending on the citation style being used. This complexity is further compounded when dealing with multiple sources or when integrating citations into a complex argument. The manual effort involved in ensuring that citations are correctly formatted and appropriately placed can be substantial, often detracting from the primary task of writing and research.</p><p>The rise of digital tools has provided some relief in this area, with software applications offering automated citation generation and management. However, these tools are not without limitations. While they can assist in formatting citations, they often fall short in terms of understanding the contextual nuances that determine when and where a citation should be placed. Moreover, they tend to treat citations as a uniform task, failing to account for the varying levels of detail that may be required in different contexts. As a result, there is a growing need for more sophisticated solutions that can handle the complexities of citation generation with greater precision. LLMs, with their ability to process and generate human-like text, offer a promising avenue for addressing these challenges. By training LLMs on large datasets of academic writing, it becomes possible to imbue them with an understanding of the diverse citation practices employed across different disciplines, thereby enabling them to generate citations that are both contextually appropriate and accurately formatted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Motivation and Objectives</head><p>The motivation behind this study stems from the recognition that while existing citation generation tools provide valuable assistance to researchers, there remains a significant gap in their ability to produce citations that are finely tuned to the specific needs of different contexts. This gap is particularly pronounced in the case of LLMs, which, despite their advanced capabilities, often struggle to replicate the nuanced citation practices that characterize academic writing. The objective of this research is to bridge this gap by developing a methodology for learning fine-grained superficial citations using Mistral, an open-source LLM. The focus on superficial citations is intentional, aiming to capture the surface-level features of citation practices that are often overlooked in existing models. Through the development and evaluation of this methodology, the study seeks to contribute to the broader goal of improving the accuracy and reliability of automated citation generation, ultimately enhancing the quality of academic writing produced with the assistance of LLMs. This study's objectives include the development of a comprehensive dataset that encapsulates the diverse citation practices observed in academic literature, the design of a feature extraction process that captures the relevant contextual and semantic features of citations, and the training of a model capable of generating fine-grained superficial citations. The success of this research will be measured through a series of evaluations that compare the performance of the developed model against existing citation generation tools, with a particular focus on the accuracy and contextual appropriateness of the generated citations. By achieving these objectives, the study aims to advance the field of automated citation generation, providing a valuable tool for researchers and contributing to the ongoing efforts to integrate LLMs into the academic writing process.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methodology</head><p>The methodology employed in this study was meticulously designed to explore and develop a framework for learning fine-grained citation patterns using the Mistral LLM. The focus of the methodology was on systematically collecting and preprocessing a diverse corpus of academic papers, extracting relevant features that capture the nuanced aspects of citation practices, developing a model architecture tailored to citation generation, and evaluating the model's performance through rigorous metrics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data Collection and Preprocessing</head><p>The data collection process was integral to the success of this study, involving the assembly of a comprehensive and diverse corpus of academic papers from multiple disciplines to ensure that the model could learn a wide range of citation patterns. These carefully designed preprocessing steps preserved the integrity of the original text while enhancing the model's ability to learn from the data. The structured and cleaned data provided a solid foundation for the subsequent phases of feature extraction and model development, ultimately contributing to more accurate and contextually appropriate citation generation. The following steps were taken during the data collection and preprocessing phases: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Feature Engineering</head><p>Feature engineering played a critical role in capturing the essential elements of citation patterns, focusing on both contextual and semantic features that are crucial for accurate citation generation. The extraction of these features can be mathematically represented by the following expressions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Contextual Features: C(x) = Ω ∇ L(x, y) + λ n i=1 ϕ i (x) dΩ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Semantic Features:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">S(x) = lim ϵ→0 1 ϵ m i=1 σ ∂Ψ(x) ∂x i • δ(x i ),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where L(x, y) represents the loss function associated with the placement of citations, λ is a regularization parameter, ϕ i (x) denotes the feature functions, and Ψ(x) encapsulates the semantic context surrounding the citations.</p><p>Contextual features (C(x)) included the location of citations within the text, the relationship between cited works and the surrounding content, and the frequency of citation usage across different sections of the papers. Semantic features (S(x)) were derived from the surrounding text, including the sentiment expressed, the importance of the cited work relative to the overall argument, and the degree of specificity or generality in the citation's context. These features were extracted using advanced natural language processing techniques, formalized as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Feature Extraction: F(x) = K k=1 α k (C k (x) • S k (x)) • T (x),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where α k are weighting coefficients, C k (x) and S k (x) represent contextual and semantic features respectively, and T (x) denotes the transformation function applied to the feature vector.</p><p>The combination of contextual and semantic features provided a rich set of inputs that enabled the model to learn not only when and where citations should be placed but also how to match the citation style to the specific needs of the text. The feature extraction process was designed to capture the subtle variations in citation practices across different academic disciplines, formalized through the calculus-based feature mapping equations. This approach ensured that the model could adapt to a wide range of contexts and generate citations that were both precise and relevant. By integrating these features into the model, the study achieved a higher level of granularity in citation generation, allowing for the creation of citations that were finely tuned to the specific needs of the text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Model Development</head><p>The development of the model was centered on fine-tuning the Mistral LLM for citation generation, leveraging its advanced language processing capabilities to replicate the complex citation patterns observed in the collected corpus. The model architecture, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, was designed to incorporate the features extracted during the feature engineering phase, with a focus on enabling the model to learn from both the contextual and semantic aspects of citation usage.</p><p>The training process involved the use of supervised learning techniques, where the model was exposed to a large number of examples from the corpus, allowing it to learn the relationships between the input features and the correct citation outputs. The model's architecture was optimized to handle the variability in citation practices across different disciplines, ensuring that it could generate citations that were both contextually appropriate and accurately formatted. The fine-tuning process was iterative, with the model being continually refined based on its performance on validation data. This approach allowed for the gradual improvement of the model's accuracy, with each iteration bringing the model closer to achieving the desired level of precision in citation generation. The model was also designed to be scalable, capable of handling large volumes of text and generating citations in real-time as the author writes. This scalability was achieved through the use of parallel processing techniques, which allowed the model to generate citations quickly and efficiently, even when working with complex and lengthy academic papers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Evaluation Metrics</head><p>The evaluation of the model's performance was conducted using a set of rigorous metrics that measured both the accuracy and contextual appropriateness of the generated citations. As detailed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, precision and recall were used to assess the model's ability to generate citations that were correctly placed and relevant to the text, while the F1-score provided a balanced measure of the model's overall performance. These metrics were chosen to ensure that the model was not only generating citations accurately but also doing so in a way that was consistent with the citation practices observed in the training data.</p><p>The evaluation process involved testing the model on a separate set of academic papers that were not included in the training data, allowing for an objective assessment of the model's generalizability. The results of the evaluation were used to further refine the model, with the goal of achieving a level of performance that would make the model a valuable tool for automating the citation generation process in academic writing. The use of these evaluation metrics provided a clear and quantifiable measure of the model's success, ensuring that the study's objectives were met and that the final model was capable of generating fine-grained citations that were both accurate and contextually appropriate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments and Results</head><p>In this section, we present a detailed exposition of the experiments conducted to validate the effectiveness of the developed citation generation model, systematically demonstrating its capabilities through various performance metrics and comparisons with established baselines. The experimental design was meticulously crafted to ensure the robustness of the results, encompassing a range of tests that evaluate the model's performance across multiple dimensions, including training efficiency, accuracy, generalizability, and practical applicability in real-world academic writing scenarios. The outcomes are discussed in four distinct subsections, each addressing different aspects of the experimental results, with a focus on providing a comprehensive understanding of the model's strengths and limitations. The results are illustrated through carefully constructed figures and tables, which are designed to clearly convey the quantitative findings of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Training and Validation</head><p>The training process for the model involved the use of a carefully curated dataset, which was divided into training, validation, and test sets to ensure that the model's performance was thoroughly evaluated at each stage. The training dataset consisted of a diverse array of academic papers, representing multiple disciplines and citation styles, which enabled the model to learn a broad spectrum of citation patterns. During the training phase, the model parameters were optimized through a series of iterative updates, using a supervised learning approach that involved backpropagation and gradient descent. The model's performance was monitored via the validation set, allowing for real-time adjustments to the training process to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model remained generalizable. The training loss, as depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>, demonstrated a steady decrease over time, indicating that the model was effectively learning from the data. The validation loss followed a similar trend, though it plateaued at a certain point, suggesting that further training would not yield significant improvements. The model's final performance was evaluated on the test set, which was not used during training or validation, to provide an objective assessment of the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.  The training and validation process revealed several challenges, including the need to balance the model's complexity with the risk of overfitting. Early stopping techniques were employed to mitigate overfitting, and the final model parameters were selected based on the best validation performance. The model achieved convergence after approximately 100 epochs, with a final validation loss that indicated strong generalization capabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Model Performance</head><p>The model's performance was rigorously tested using the evaluation metrics previously defined. Precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated across the test set, providing a detailed understanding of the model's ability to generate accurate and contextually appropriate citations. The results, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, demonstrate that the model consistently achieved high scores across all metrics, indicating that it was effective in both identifying relevant citation contexts and generating accurate citations that adhered to the specified formatting guidelines. The F1-score, which provides a balanced measure of precision and recall, was particularly noteworthy, indicating that the model was successful in balancing the trade-off between generating too many citations (high recall) and generating only the most relevant citations (high precision). The contextual accuracy and citation placement accuracy metrics further demonstrated the model's ability to generate citations that were not only accurate but also appropriately placed within the text, ensuring that the citations supported the author's arguments effectively. The overall performance metrics suggest that the model is well-suited for automating the citation generation process, offering high accuracy and contextual relevance that are critical for maintaining the integrity of academic writing. The results indicate that the model is capable of performing at a level comparable to, if not exceeding, existing citation generation tools, particularly in terms of precision and contextual understanding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Comparison with Baselines</head><p>To further validate the effectiveness of the developed model, its performance was compared with several baseline methods, including rule-based citation generation systems and heuristic approaches. The comparison was conducted across the same test set used for evaluating the model, ensuring that the results were directly comparable. The baseline systems were selected based on their prevalence in current academic writing tools and their relevance to the task of citation generation. The results, summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>, indicate that the Mistral LLM significantly outperformed the baseline methods across all evaluation metrics. The precision and recall scores of the baseline systems were notably lower, reflecting their reliance on predefined rules and heuristics that do not account for the complex, context-dependent nature of citation practices in academic writing. The F1-score of the Mistral LLM was markedly higher, demonstrating its ability to balance precision and recall more effectively than the baselines. Moreover, the contextual accuracy of the Mistral LLM surpassed that of the baseline methods, highlighting its superior ability to generate citations that are contextually appropriate and well-integrated into the text.</p><p>The comparison underscores the advantages of using LLMs for citation generation, particularly in terms of their ability to learn and replicate the nuanced citation patterns observed in diverse academic disciplines. The results suggest that the Mistral LLM offers a more sophisticated and reliable solution for automating the citation generation process, with significant improvements over traditional rule-based and heuristic approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Scalability and Efficiency</head><p>Scalability and efficiency are critical factors in the practical application of citation generation models, particularly when dealing with large volumes of academic text. The Mistral LLM was evaluated for its ability to generate citations efficiently across varying text lengths and complexities, with a focus on assessing the model's runtime performance and resource utilization. The results, depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, show that the model maintained consistent performance even as the length of the input text increased, demonstrating its scalability and robustness.</p><p>The scalability tests indicated that the Mistral LLM was capable of processing longer texts with only a linear increase in runtime, suggesting that the model's computational efficiency is well-suited for handling extensive academic papers. Additionally, 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 0 resource utilization remained within acceptable limits, with the model leveraging parallel processing techniques to optimize performance. The efficiency of the model was further validated through stress testing, which involved generating citations for a large corpus of academic papers in a single batch. The results confirmed that the Mistral LLM could handle high workloads without significant degradation in performance, making it a viable option for large-scale academic writing applications. The scalability and efficiency of the Mistral LLM, as demonstrated through these experiments, underscore its potential as a powerful tool for automating citation generation in a variety of academic contexts. The ability to maintain high performance across different text lengths and complexities, coupled with its efficient use of computational resources, positions the Mistral LLM as a leading solution in the domain of citation generation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Impact of Dataset Diversity on Model Performance</head><p>The diversity of the training dataset plays a crucial role in determining the robustness and generalizability of the citation generation model. To assess the impact of dataset diversity on the model's performance, we conducted experiments using training datasets with varying levels of diversity, measured in terms of the number of disciplines represented and the range of citation styles included. The results, illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>, demonstrate that as the diversity of the dataset increased, the model's performance across all evaluation metrics showed significant improvement.</p><p>The figure illustrates that an increase in the number of disciplines and citation styles within the training data led to higher F1-scores, contextual accuracy, and citation placement accuracy. This suggests that the model's ability to generalize across different academic domains was enhanced by training on a more diverse dataset. Notably, the performance gains plateaued after reaching a certain level of diversity,  indicating that beyond a certain point, additional diversity in the dataset did not result in further significant improvements. These findings highlight the importance of selecting a sufficiently diverse training corpus to maximize the model's performance, while also suggesting that there may be diminishing returns with excessive diversity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Ablation Study on Feature Importance</head><p>To understand the relative importance of the different features used in the model, an ablation study was conducted where individual features were systematically removed from the model to observe the impact on performance. The features evaluated included contextual features (location, frequency), semantic features (sentiment, importance), and syntactic features (sentence structure). The results of the ablation study are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>, which shows the change in the model's F1-score, contextual accuracy, and citation placement accuracy when each feature was excluded from the model. The table reveals that the removal of the importance feature resulted in the most significant decrease in performance across all metrics, indicating that this feature is critical for the model's ability to generate accurate and contextually appropriate citations. The location and sentiment features also had a notable impact, though to a slightly lesser extent. The relatively smaller changes observed when removing frequency and sentence structure suggest that these features, while still valuable, are less crucial for the model's overall performance. The results of the ablation study underscore the importance of each feature in contributing to the model's success, with some features playing a more pivotal role in the citation generation process than others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>The findings presented in the previous sections reveal a multifaceted understanding of the model's performance, offering valuable insights into its strengths and limitations while also highlighting areas for further exploration and refinement.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Analytical Reflexivity on Citation Patterns</head><p>The model's ability to learn and replicate complex citation patterns across various academic disciplines demonstrates a significant advancement in the automation of citation generation. The results indicate that the model effectively captured the contextual and semantic nuances that are critical for producing accurate citations, with particular success in identifying appropriate citation contexts and generating citations that align with the author's intent. This success can be attributed to the model's architecture, which was specifically designed to incorporate both contextual and semantic features, enabling it to discern subtle differences in citation practices that vary between disciplines.</p><p>However, while the model exhibited strong performance overall, certain challenges emerged during the evaluation process, particularly in handling highly specialized citation styles or unconventional formats that are less commonly represented in the training data. These instances reveal the limitations of the model's learning capacity when confronted with rare or atypical citation practices, suggesting a need for further refinement and potentially the inclusion of more diverse training data to enhance the model's adaptability. The model's performance in this area underscores the importance of ongoing iterative improvements and highlights the potential for future work to focus on expanding the model's ability to handle a wider range of citation scenarios, thus increasing its applicability across different academic fields.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Scalability and Computational Efficiency Reconsidered</head><p>The scalability and computational efficiency of the model were rigorously tested, revealing that the model is well-suited for large-scale academic applications, particularly in generating citations for lengthy and complex academic texts. The linear increase in runtime with respect to text length suggests that the model's design is optimized for handling extensive documents without a significant compromise in performance. This is a critical factor for practical deployment, especially in environments where processing large volumes of text is a common requirement, such as in academic publishing or automated manuscript preparation tools.</p><p>Nonetheless, the efficiency of the model, while commendable in most scenarios, may encounter bottlenecks in cases involving extremely large datasets or real-time processing demands. The observed computational load, though manageable within typical usage parameters, could pose challenges in high-demand settings, particularly where resources are limited. These considerations point to the potential need for further optimization, perhaps through the integration of more advanced parallel processing techniques or the refinement of the model's architecture to reduce computational overhead. Such enhancements would not only improve the model's scalability but also ensure its viability in a broader range of real-world applications, making it a more versatile tool for researchers and academic professionals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Resilience and Flexibility in Diverse Contexts</head><p>The model's resilience and flexibility were tested through various scenarios that simulated the diverse and dynamic nature of academic writing. The experiments demonstrated that the model is capable of maintaining high levels of accuracy and contextual relevance across different academic disciplines, even when faced with complex or unconventional citation practices. This resilience is a testament to the robustness of the model's design, which was informed through a thorough understanding of the diverse citation practices that exist within the academic community.</p><p>However, the model's flexibility is not without its limits. In certain cases, particularly those involving highly specific or niche citation styles, the model showed a slight decline in performance, indicating that its flexibility may be constrained in some contexts. This finding suggests that while the model is generally adaptable, there may be value in developing specialized variants of the model tailored to specific academic fields or citation practices. Such variants could be trained on more targeted datasets, thereby enhancing the model's performance in areas where it currently exhibits relative weakness. The exploration of this possibility could lead to the development of a suite of citation generation models, each optimized for different academic domains, thereby expanding the utility of automated citation tools in the scholarly ecosystem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Future Directions and Potential Enhancements</head><p>The results and observations from this study open several avenues for future research and potential enhancements of the citation generation model. One of the primary areas for future exploration is the integration of more sophisticated natural language understanding capabilities, which could further improve the model's ability to generate citations that are not only accurate but also deeply aligned with the author's rhetorical strategies and argumentative structure. This could involve the incorporation of advanced techniques such as deep semantic parsing or the use of transformerbased architectures that are specifically optimized for understanding the intricate relationships between different segments of academic text.</p><p>Moreover, the possibility of leveraging transfer learning to adapt the model to new citation styles or emerging academic fields offers another promising direction for future research. Through fine-tuning the model on more specialized datasets, it would be possible to extend its applicability to a wider range of academic contexts, ensuring that it remains relevant and useful as citation practices evolve. Additionally, exploring the potential of incorporating feedback mechanisms, where the model learns from user corrections or preferences, could lead to a more interactive and adaptive citation generation tool that evolves in response to the needs of its users. Such advancements would not only enhance the model's functionality but also contribute to the broader goal of integrating artificial intelligence into the academic writing process in a way that is both supportive and aligned with scholarly values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>The research conducted has demonstrated the effectiveness of leveraging large language models for the task of citation generation, highlighting their capacity to replicate complex citation patterns across diverse academic disciplines with a high degree of accuracy and contextual relevance. Through the meticulous design of the model architecture, which integrates both contextual and semantic features, the study has provided strong evidence that LLMs can substantially improve the efficiency and precision of citation generation, particularly in scenarios that demand a nuanced understanding of the relationships between cited works and the surrounding text. The experiments, which were rigorously conducted across various dimensions, including training, validation, and comparison with baseline methods, have revealed that the model not only outperforms traditional citation tools in terms of precision and recall but also exhibits robust scalability and computational efficiency when applied to large and complex academic texts. Moreover, the findings suggest that the model's ability to generalize across different academic fields, while maintaining a high level of performance, positions it as a valuable tool for researchers and academic professionals seeking to streamline the citation process without compromising the integrity and quality of their work. The study, therefore, offers a significant contribution to the field of automated citation generation, demonstrating that LLMs can play a pivotal role in enhancing the academic writing process, particularly in an era where the volume of scholarly output continues to grow exponentially.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1 . 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Selection of Academic Papers: (a) Diversity of Citation Styles: Papers were chosen to represent a variety of citation styles across different academic disciplines, ensuring the model's exposure to a broad spectrum of citation practices.
