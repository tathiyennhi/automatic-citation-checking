  "text": "Furthermore, Flair has shown better accuracy for NER tasks using pre-trained datasets in comparison with many other open source NLP tools.4 In the first experiment (Sect. 4.1) we trained and implemented a NER task using three default Flair NER models with two differently-sized corpora.5 All the descriptions of the Flair framework features refer to the releases 0.9 and 0.11. The models were trained to recognize six types of acknowledged entities: funding agency, grant number, individuals, university, corporation, and miscellaneous. The model with the best accuracy can be applied for the comprehensive analysis of the acknowledgment texts. In Experiments 2 and 3 we performed additional training with altered training parameters or altered training corpora (Sects 4.2 and 4.3). Most of the previous works on acknowledgment analysis were limited by the manual evaluation of data and therefore by the amount of processed data [CITATION_1].",
