Moreover, IND and GRNB categories showed better performance for other algorithms too, which could lie in the structure of these entities: names of individuals and grant numbers usually have undiversified patterns and in acknowledgement texts are used in a small variety of contexts. At the same time, other entity types, such as funding organisations and universities could have similar patterns and could be used in the same context. In some cases, even for human annotators, it is impossible to distinguish between university, funding body and corporation without background knowledge about the entity. Previous works showed improvements in downstream tasks using embedding models fine-tuned for the domain used [CITATION_1].",
