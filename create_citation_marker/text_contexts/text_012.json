  "text": "We used a standard approach, where only a linear classifier layer was added on the top of the transformer, as adding the additional CRF decoder between the transformer and linear classifier did not increase accuracy compared with this standard approach [CITATION_1]. The chosen transformer model uses subword tokenization. We used the mean of embeddings of all subtokens and concatenation of all transformer layers to produce embeddings. The context around the sentence was considered. The training was initiated with a small learning rate using the Adam Optimisation Algorithm (Kingma & Ba, 2014).",
