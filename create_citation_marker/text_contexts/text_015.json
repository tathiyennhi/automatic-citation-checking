  "text": "We are planning to fine-tune BERT and Flair Embeddings (contextual string embeddings) on a sample of approx. 5 million acknowledgment texts from WoS and evaluate the performance of the NER models. The results of Experiment 2 generally did not show an improvement in accuracy. On the contrary, training with the three entity types deteriorated the model performance. Training without the MISC category did not show significant performance progress either. Moreover, further analysis of acknowledged entities showed that the miscellaneous category contained very inhomogeneous and partly irrelevant data, making the analysis more complicated [CITATION_1].",
