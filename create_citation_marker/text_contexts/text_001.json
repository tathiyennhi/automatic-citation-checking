  "text": "Cronin and Weaver (1995) ascribe an acknowledgment alongside authorship and citedness to measures of a researcher’s scholarly performance: a feature that reflects the researcher’s productivity and impact. Giles and Councill (2004) argue that acknowledgments to individuals, in the same way as citations, may be used as a metric to measure an individual’s intellectual contribution to scientific work. Acknowledgments of financial support are interesting in terms of evaluating the influence of funding agencies on academic research. Acknowledgments of technical and instrumental support may reveal “indirect contributions of research laboratories and universities to research activities” [CITATION_1]. The analysis of acknowledgments is particularly interesting as acknowledgments may give an insight into aspects of the scientific community, such as reward systems [CITATION_2], collaboration patterns, and hidden research trends [CITATION_3].",
