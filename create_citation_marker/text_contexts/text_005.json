  "text": "English data for the corpus were taken from the Reuters corpus. The dataset comprises four types of named entities: person, location, organisation, and miscellaneous. However, specific domains require specifically labelled training data. The development of a training dataset for the specific domain is an expensive and time-consuming process since NER usually requires a quite large training corpus. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to evaluate the performance of existing embedding models for the task of automatic extraction and classification of acknowledged entities from the acknowledgment text in scientific papers using small training datasets or without training data (zero-short approach). 1 http:// wokin fo. com/ produ cts_ tools/ multi disci plina ry/ webof scien ce/ fundi ngsea rch/. 1 3 Scientometrics The present paper is an extended version of the article [CITATION_1]2 presented at the 3rd Workshop on Extraction and Evaluation of Knowledge Entities from Scientific Documents (EEKE2022).3 Flair, an open-source natural language processing (NLP) framework [CITATION_2] is used in our study to create a tool for the extraction of acknowledged entities because this library is easily customizable.",
