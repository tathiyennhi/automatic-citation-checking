  "text": "Figure 1 demonstrates an example of acknowledged entities of different types. To the best of our knowledge, Giles and Councill’s classification is the only existing classification of acknowledged entities and therefore can be applied to the NER task. Other works on acknowledgment analysis were focused on the classification of acknowledgment texts. The Flair NLP framework Flair is an open-sourced NLP framework built on PyTorch [CITATION_1], which is an open-source machine learning library. “The core idea of the framework is to present a simple, unified interface for conceptually very different types of word and document embeddings” [CITATION_2]. Flair has three default training algorithms for NER which were used for the first experiment in the present research: a) NER Model with Flair Embeddings (later on Flair Embeddings) [CITATION_3], b) NER Model with Transformers (later on Transformers) [CITATION_4], and c) Zero-shot NER with TARS (later on TARS) [CITATION_5] 8.",
