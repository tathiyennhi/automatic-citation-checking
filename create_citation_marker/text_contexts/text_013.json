  "text": "As a result, training without a MISC category might potentially show better performance. To examine this hypothesis, we conducted training with Flair Embeddings with a dataset excluding the MISC category, i.e., with five entity types. Training results are shown in Fig. 6A. Additionally, the problem might lie in the nature of the training algorithms that were used. On the one hand, Flair developers claimed Transformers to be the most efficient algorithm (Schweter & Akbik, 2020).",
