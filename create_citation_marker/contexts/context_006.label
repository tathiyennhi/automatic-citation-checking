[CITATION_1] argue that acknowledgments to individuals, in the same way as citations, may be used as a metric to measure an individual’s intellectual contribution to scientific work. Acknowledgments of financial support are interesting in terms of evaluating the influence of funding agencies on academic research. Acknowledgments of technical and instrumental support may reveal “indirect contributions of research laboratories and universities to research activities” [CITATION_2]. The analysis of acknowledgments is particularly interesting as acknowledgments may give an insight into aspects of the scientific community, such as reward systems [CITATION_3], collaboration patterns, and hidden research trends [CITATION_4][CITATION_5]. From the linguistic point of view, acknowledgments are unstructured text data, which through automatic analysis poses research and methodological problems like data cleaning, choosing the proper tokenization method, and whether and how word embeddings may enhance their automatic analysis. To our knowledge, previous works on automatic acknowledgment analysis were mostly concerned with the extraction of funding organizations and grant numbers [CITATION_6][CITATION_7][CITATION_8] or classification of acknowledgment texts [CITATION_9][CITATION_10]. Furthermore, large bibliographic databases such as Web of Science (WoS)1 and Scopus selectively index only funding information, i.e., names of funding organizations and grant identification numbers. Consequently, we want to extend that to other types of acknowledged entities: individuals, universities, corporations, and other miscellaneous information. Analysis of the acknowledged individuals provides insight into informal scientific collaboration [CITATION_11][CITATION_12]. Acknowledged universities and corporations reveal interactions and knowledge exchange between industry and universities [CITATION_13]. Entities from the miscellaneous category include other information like project names, which could uncover international scientific collaborations.
