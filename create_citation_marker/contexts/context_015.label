Therefore, more than one annotator is usually required to provide credible results. That is why 2 In this paper we conducted an additional experiment (Experiment 3) with 2 new corpora (corpus Nos. 3 and 4). 3 https:// eeke- works hop. github. io/ 2022/. 4 https:// github. com/ flair NLP/ flair. 5 The release 0.9 (https:// github. com/ flair NLP/ flair/ relea ses/ tag/ v0.9) was used in the experiments 1 and 2. Experiment 3 was performed using release 0.11 (https:// github. com/ flair NLP/ flair/ relea ses/ tag/ v0. 11). 1 3 Scientometrics it is of interest to test if the existing NER models can provide reasonable accuracy while using small or no training data. Background and related work Research in the field of acknowledgments analysis has been carried out since the 1970s. The first typology of acknowledgments was proposed by [CITATION_1] [CITATION_2] and comprised three categories: facilities, access to data, and help of individuals. [CITATION_3] distinguished five types of acknowledgements: research-related information, secondary access to research-related information, specific research-related communication, general peer communication, and technical or clerical support. [CITATION_4] defined three broad categories: resource-, procedure- and concept-related. [CITATION_5] developed a four-level classification based on sponsored research field: change maker, incremental, breakthrough, and matured. [CITATION_6] distinguished acknowledgements from the perspective of appreciation of influential scholars and defined two axes: scientific influence and institutional influence. Scientific influence refers to the productiveness and creativity of the researcher, while institutional influence is associated with the scholar’s administrative position in the scientific community. [CITATION_7] investigated the connection between research funding and the development of science and technology using acknowledgments from articles from the field of nanotechnology.
