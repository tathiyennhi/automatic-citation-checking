[CITATION_1] distinguished five types of acknowledgements: research-related information, secondary access to research-related information, specific research-related communication, general peer communication, and technical or clerical support. [CITATION_2] defined three broad categories: resource-, procedure- and concept-related. [CITATION_3] developed a four-level classification based on sponsored research field: change maker, incremental, breakthrough, and matured. [CITATION_4] distinguished acknowledgements from the perspective of appreciation of influential scholars and defined two axes: scientific influence and institutional influence. Scientific influence refers to the productiveness and creativity of the researcher, while institutional influence is associated with the scholar’s administrative position in the scientific community. [CITATION_5] investigated the connection between research funding and the development of science and technology using acknowledgments from articles from the field of nanotechnology. [CITATION_6] studied informal cooperation in academic research. The analysis revealed generational and gender differences in informal collaboration. The authors claim that information from informal collaboration networks makes better predictions of the academic impact of researchers and articles than information from co-author networks. [CITATION_7] argued that the classification of funders could be useful in developing funding strategies for policymakers and funders. [CITATION_8] manually investigated acknowledgement sections of papers, which were published or preprinted in association with the Cowles Foundation between early 1940 and 1970 to trace the influence of the informal social structure and academic leaders on the early acceptance of scientific innovations.
