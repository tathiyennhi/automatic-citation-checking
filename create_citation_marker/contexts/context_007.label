The analysis of acknowledgments is particularly interesting as acknowledgments may give an insight into aspects of the scientific community, such as reward systems [CITATION_1], collaboration patterns, and hidden research trends [CITATION_2][CITATION_3]. From the linguistic point of view, acknowledgments are unstructured text data, which through automatic analysis poses research and methodological problems like data cleaning, choosing the proper tokenization method, and whether and how word embeddings may enhance their automatic analysis. To our knowledge, previous works on automatic acknowledgment analysis were mostly concerned with the extraction of funding organizations and grant numbers [CITATION_4][CITATION_5][CITATION_6] or classification of acknowledgment texts [CITATION_7][CITATION_8]. Furthermore, large bibliographic databases such as Web of Science (WoS)1 and Scopus selectively index only funding information, i.e., names of funding organizations and grant identification numbers. Consequently, we want to extend that to other types of acknowledged entities: individuals, universities, corporations, and other miscellaneous information. Analysis of the acknowledged individuals provides insight into informal scientific collaboration [CITATION_9][CITATION_10]. Acknowledged universities and corporations reveal interactions and knowledge exchange between industry and universities [CITATION_11]. Entities from the miscellaneous category include other information like project names, which could uncover international scientific collaborations. The state-of-the-art named entity recognition (NER) models showed a great performance on the CoNLL-2003 dataset [CITATION_12][CITATION_13][CITATION_14][CITATION_15]. CoNLL-2003 corpus [CITATION_16] is a benchmark dataset for language-independent named entity recognition, i.e., designed to train and evaluate NER models. English data for the corpus were taken from the Reuters corpus.
