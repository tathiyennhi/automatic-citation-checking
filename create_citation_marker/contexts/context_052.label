Corpora Nos.1, 2, and 3 were created for the MinAck project and serve the purpose of a general evaluation of the impact of the size of the training corpus on the model performance. Corpus No.4 was designed specifically for the SEASON project in the hope of improving the recognition of Indian funding information. The project SEASON aims to get insight into German-Indian scientific collaboration. Our other corpora mainly contain papers published by European institutions. That is why we enhance Corpus 4 with the papers published by Indian institutions. 10 https:// resea rchfi sh. com/. 11 https:// www. nlm. nih. gov/ bsd/ fundi ng_ suppo rt. html. 1 3 Scientometrics Fig. 2 The distribution of acknowledged entities in the training corpora chosen since previous work on acknowledgment analysis revealed the relations between the scientific domain and the types of acknowledged entities, i.e., acknowledged individuals are more characteristic of theoretical and social-oriented domains. At the same time, information on technical and instrumental support is more common for the natural and life sciences domains [CITATION_1]. Only the WoS record types “article” and “review” published in a scientific journal in English were selected; then 1000 distinct acknowledgments texts were randomly gathered from this sample for the training dataset. Further different amounts of sentences containing acknowledged entities were distributed into the differently-sized training corpora. Table 2 demonstrates the number of sentences in each set in the four corpora. We selected only sentences that contain an acknowledged entity, regardless of the scientific domain. Table 3 contains the number of sentences and texts from each scientific domain in the training corpora.12 The same article can belong to several scientific domains, therefore, the number of sentences and texts in Tables 2 and 3 does not match.
