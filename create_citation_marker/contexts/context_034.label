The aim of the study was to create a database containing unified academic information about individuals to help in expert finding. A labeled training dataset was developed using biographies extracted from ORCID.6 The authors tested several models for NER. The Support Vector Machine classification algorithm (SVM) showed the best performance. [CITATION_1] proposed a strategy for the identification of software in scientific bioinformatics publications using the combination of SVM and CRF (Conditional Random Field). Application of the method to the sample of articles from bioinformatics domains allowed them to observe interesting patterns in using software in scientific research. [CITATION_2] analysed scholarly relationships by analysing acknowledged individuals from the acknowledgments statements from eight open-access journals. 6 https:// orcid. org/. 1 3 Scientometrics Individuals were extracted using the Stanford CoreNLP NER tagger. In the next steps, scholars were identified among the extracted individuals by mapping them to the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG). We are aware of several works on automated information extraction from acknowledgments. [CITATION_3] developed an automated method for the extraction and analysis of acknowledgment texts using regular expressions and SVM. Computer science research papers from the CiteSeer digital library were used as a data source. Extracted entities were analysed and manually assigned to the following four categories: funding agencies, corporations, universities, and individuals.
