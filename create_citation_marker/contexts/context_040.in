The aim of the study was to determine an approach to "increase the speed of ... classification without sacrificing accuracy, nor reliability" (Thomer & Weber, 2014, p. 1134). Kayal et al. (2017) introduced a method for extraction of funding organizations and grants from acknowledgment texts using a combination of sequential learning models: conditional random fields (CRF), hidden markov models (HMM), and maximum entropy models (MaxEnt). The final model contained pooled outputs from the models used. Alexandera and Vries (2021) proposed AckNER, a tool for extracting financial information from the funding or acknowledgment section of a research article. AckNER works with the use of dependency parse trees and regular expressions and is able to extract names of the organisations, projects, programs, and funds, as also numbers of contracts and grants7. Following, Borst et al. (2022) applied a question-answering (QA) based approach to identify funding information in acknowledgments texts. This approach performs similarly to AckNER and requires a smaller set of training and test data. Table 1 shows an overview of works on NER in scientometrics. Overall, previous works on the extraction of named entities from acknowledgements texts were mostly concerned with the extraction of funding information, i.e., only names of funding bodies and grant numbers, or extraction and linking of individuals. The special issue by Zhang et al. (2023) provided a recent overview of current works in the extraction of knowledge entities. To the best of our knowledge the work of Giles and Councill (2004) is the only attempt to extract and categorise multiple acknowledged entities.
