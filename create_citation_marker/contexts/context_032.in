Evaluation of the model performance showed good results. Opposed to previous unsupervised NER approaches, Iovine et al. (2022) proposed a cycle-consistency approach for NER (CycleNER). CycleNER is unsupervised and does not require parallel training data. The method showed 73% of supervised performance on CoNLL03. NER in scientometrics analysis Named entities are widely used in scientometrics analysis. Thus, Kenekayoro (2018) developed a supervised method for the automatic extraction of named entities from academic bibliographies. The aim of the study was to create a database containing unified academic information about individuals to help in expert finding. A labeled training dataset was developed using biographies extracted from ORCID.6 The authors tested several models for NER. The Support Vector Machine classification algorithm (SVM) showed the best performance. Jiang et al. (2022) proposed a strategy for the identification of software in scientific bioinformatics publications using the combination of SVM and CRF (Conditional Random Field). Application of the method to the sample of articles from bioinformatics domains allowed them to observe interesting patterns in using software in scientific research.
