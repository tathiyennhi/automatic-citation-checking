AckNER works with the use of dependency parse trees and regular expressions and is able to extract names of the organisations, projects, programs, and funds, as also numbers of contracts and grants7. Following, Borst et al. (2022) applied a question-answering (QA) based approach to identify funding information in acknowledgments texts. This approach performs similarly to AckNER and requires a smaller set of training and test data. Table 1 shows an overview of works on NER in scientometrics. Overall, previous works on the extraction of named entities from acknowledgements texts were mostly concerned with the extraction of funding information, i.e., only names of funding bodies and grant numbers, or extraction and linking of individuals. The special issue by Zhang et al. (2023) provided a recent overview of current works in the extraction of knowledge entities. To the best of our knowledge the work of Giles and Councill (2004) is the only attempt to extract and categorise multiple acknowledged entities. Nevertheless, entities were extracted using the SVM algorithm but the classification of entities themselves was produced manually, which limited the number of acknowledgement texts to be analysed. Furthermore, as far as we know, there was no research done concerning the evaluation of embedding models for extraction of information from acknowledgement texts and no tool for automatic extraction of different kinds of acknowledged entities was developed. 7 AckNER showed better performance as Flair, but is specifically designed to recognize two types of acknowledged entities (Alexandera & Vries, 2021), which was insufficient for the present project. 1 3 Scientometrics 1 3 scirtemotneics ni REN no skrow fo weivrevO 1 elbaT sloot dna sdohteM seititnE suproC fo mia dna noitacilppa fo aerA repaP yduts eht dna seititne gnitcartxe rof MVS ,seinapmoC ,seicnega gnidnuF reeSetiC -itne degdelwonkca fo noitcartxE )4002( llicnuoC dna seliG noitacfiissalc launam rieht ,snoitutitsnI lanoitacudE stnemegdelwonkca mrof seit slaudividnI rezingoceR ytitnE drofnatS ssalc-4 ,snoitazinagro ,snoitacol ,snosreP sseccA nepO s’lartneC deMbuP -acfiissalc evorpmi ot REN gnisU )4102( rebeW dna remohT suoenallecsim dna stnemegdelwonkca fo noit tnExaM ,MMH ,FRC stnarg ,seidob gnidnuF sseccA nepO s’lartneC deMbuP noitamrofni gnidnuf fo noitcartxE )7102( .la te layaK stnemegdelwonkca morf MVS ,noitazinagrO ,noitacoL ,drawA DICRO -amrofni yhpargoib fo noitcartxE )8102( oroyakeneK -azilaicepS ,noitisoP ,nosreP seihpargoib cimedaca morf noit srehtO ,noit -uger + resrap ycnedneped yCapS stnarg ,seidob gnidnuF yrotisoper lanoitutitsni s’tfleD UT noitamrofni gnidnuf fo noitcartxE )1202( seirV dna arednaxelA snoisserpxe ral stnemegdelwonkca morf FRC-sMVSelbmesnE slanruoj scitamrofnioib erawtfos cfiitneics fo noitcartxE )2202( .la te gnaiJ lluf( selcitra cfiitneics morf scitamrofnioib ni )stxet kcatsyaH stnarg ,seidob gnidnuF rotSnocE noitamrofni gnidnuf fo noitcartxE )2202( .la te tsroB stnemegdelwonkca morf + reggat REN PLNeroC drofnatS slaudividnI SOLP fo gniknil dna noitcartxE )2202( onaS dna igemusuK GAM morf slaudividni degdelwonkca stnemegdelwonkca Scientometrics Fig. 1 An example of acknowledged entities. Each entity type is marked with a distinct color Method In the present paper, different models for extraction and classification of acknowledged entities supported by the Flair NLP framework were evaluated. The choice of classification was inspired by Giles and Councill’s (2004) classification: funding agencies (FUND), corporations (COR), universities (UNI), and individuals (IND).
