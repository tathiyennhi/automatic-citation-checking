Thus, in our case, stacked embeddings comprise GloVe embeddings, forward contextual string embeddings, and backward contextual string embeddings. The model was trained with the recommended parameters: the size of mini-batches was set to 32 and the maximum number of epochs was set to 150. For Transformers, training was initiated with the RoBERTa model (Liu et al., 2019). For the present paper, a fine-tuning approach was used. The fine-tuning procedure consisted of adding a linear layer to a transformer and retraining the entire network with a small learning rate. We used a standard approach, where only a linear classifier layer was added on the top of the transformer, as adding the additional CRF decoder between the transformer and linear classifier did not increase accuracy compared with this standard approach (Schweter & Akbik, 2020). The chosen transformer model uses subword tokenization. We used the mean of embeddings of all subtokens and concatenation of all transformer layers to produce embeddings. The context around the sentence was considered. The training was initiated with a small learning rate using the Adam Optimisation Algorithm (Kingma & Ba, 2014). The TARS model requires labels to be defined in a natural language.
