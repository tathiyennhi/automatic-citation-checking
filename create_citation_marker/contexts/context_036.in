In the next steps, scholars were identified among the extracted individuals by mapping them to the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG). We are aware of several works on automated information extraction from acknowledgments. Giles and Councill (2004) developed an automated method for the extraction and analysis of acknowledgment texts using regular expressions and SVM. Computer science research papers from the CiteSeer digital library were used as a data source. Extracted entities were analysed and manually assigned to the following four categories: funding agencies, corporations, universities, and individuals. Thomer and Weber (2014) used the 4-class Stanford Entity Recognizer (Finkel et al., 2005) to extract persons, locations, organizations, and miscellaneous entities from the collection of bioinformatics texts from PubMed Central’s Open Access corpus. The aim of the study was to determine an approach to "increase the speed of ... classification without sacrificing accuracy, nor reliability" (Thomer & Weber, 2014, p. 1134). Kayal et al. (2017) introduced a method for extraction of funding organizations and grants from acknowledgment texts using a combination of sequential learning models: conditional random fields (CRF), hidden markov models (HMM), and maximum entropy models (MaxEnt). The final model contained pooled outputs from the models used. Alexandera and Vries (2021) proposed AckNER, a tool for extracting financial information from the funding or acknowledgment section of a research article. AckNER works with the use of dependency parse trees and regular expressions and is able to extract names of the organisations, projects, programs, and funds, as also numbers of contracts and grants7.
