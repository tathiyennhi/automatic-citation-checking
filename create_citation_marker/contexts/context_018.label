Background and related work Research in the field of acknowledgments analysis has been carried out since the 1970s. The first typology of acknowledgments was proposed by [CITATION_1] [CITATION_2] and comprised three categories: facilities, access to data, and help of individuals. [CITATION_3] distinguished five types of acknowledgements: research-related information, secondary access to research-related information, specific research-related communication, general peer communication, and technical or clerical support. [CITATION_4] defined three broad categories: resource-, procedure- and concept-related. [CITATION_5] developed a four-level classification based on sponsored research field: change maker, incremental, breakthrough, and matured. [CITATION_6] distinguished acknowledgements from the perspective of appreciation of influential scholars and defined two axes: scientific influence and institutional influence. Scientific influence refers to the productiveness and creativity of the researcher, while institutional influence is associated with the scholar’s administrative position in the scientific community. [CITATION_7] investigated the connection between research funding and the development of science and technology using acknowledgments from articles from the field of nanotechnology. [CITATION_8] studied informal cooperation in academic research. The analysis revealed generational and gender differences in informal collaboration. The authors claim that information from informal collaboration networks makes better predictions of the academic impact of researchers and articles than information from co-author networks.
