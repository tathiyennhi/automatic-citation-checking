The model works more precisely for some entity types than for others; thus, individuals and grant numbers showed a very good F1-Score over 0.9. Most of the previous works on acknowledgment analysis were limited by the manual evaluation of data and therefore by the amount of processed data. This model can be applied for the comprehensive analysis of acknowledgment texts and may potentially make a great contribution to the field of automated acknowledgment analysis.

Cronin and Weaver (1995) ascribe an acknowledgment alongside authorship and citedness to measures of a researcher’s scholarly performance: a feature that reflects the researcher’s productivity and impact. Giles and Councill (2004) argue that acknowledgments to individuals, in the same way as citations, may be used as a metric to measure an individual’s intellectual contribution to scientific work. Acknowledgments of financial support are interesting in terms of evaluating the influence of funding agencies on academic research. Acknowledgments of technical and instrumental support may reveal “indirect contributions of research laboratories and universities to research activities” (Giles & Councill, 2004, p. 17599). The analysis of acknowledgments is particularly interesting as acknowledgments may give an insight into aspects of the scientific community, such as reward systems (Dzieżyc & Kazienko, 2022), collaboration patterns, and hidden research trends (Giles & Councill, 2004; Diaz-Faes & Bordons, 2017). From the linguistic point of view, acknowledgments are unstructured text data, which through automatic analysis poses research and methodological problems like data cleaning, choosing the proper tokenization method, and whether and how word embeddings may enhance their automatic analysis. To our knowledge, previous works on automatic acknowledgment analysis were mostly concerned with the extraction of funding organizations and grant numbers (Alexandera & Vries, 2021; Kayal et al., 2017; Borst et al., 2022) or classification of acknowledgment texts (Song et al., 2020; Hubbard et al., 2022).
