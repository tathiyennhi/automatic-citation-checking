The Flair Embeddings model uses stacked embeddings, i.e., a combination of contextual string embeddings [CITATION_1] with a static embeddings model. This approach will generate different embeddings for the same word depending on its context. Stacked embedding is an important Flair feature, as a combination of different embeddings might bring better results than their separate uses [CITATION_2]. The Transformers model or FLERT-extension (document-level features for NER) is a set of settings to perform a NER on the document level using fine-tuning and feature-based 8 New transformer models as SciBERT or SsciBERT were not evaluated in this study, as the objective of the study is to evaluate the performance of the Flair default models. 1 3 Scientometrics Table 2 Number of sentences/texts in the training corpora Corpus No. Training set (train) Test set (test) Validation set (dev) Total 1 29/27 10/10 10/10 49/47 2 339/282 165/150 150/136 654/441 3 784/657 165/150 150/136 1099/816 4 1148/885 165/150 150/136 1463/1044 Table 3 Number of sentences/texts from each scientific domain in the training corpora Corpus No. Oceanography Economics Social Sciences Computer Science 1 13/13 3/3 20/20 16/14 2 127/75 92/58 351/234 173/129 3 175/112 128/89 590/434 333/269 LSTM-CRF with the multilingual XML-RoBERTa transformer model [CITATION_3]. The TARS (task-aware representation of sentences) is a transformer-based model, which allows performing training without any training data (zero-shot learning) or with a small dataset (few-short learning) [CITATION_4]. The TARS approach differs from the traditional transfer learning approach in the way that the TARS model also considers semantic information captured in the class labels themselves. For example, for analyzing acknowledgments, class labels like funding organization or university already carry semantic information. Training data The Web of Science (WoS) database was used to harvest the training data (funding acknowledgments).9 From 2008 on, WoS started indexing information about funders and grants. WoS uses information from different funding reporting systems such as Researchfish,10 Medline11 and others.
