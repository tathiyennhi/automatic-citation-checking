The model showed good results in discipline classification and abstract structure-function recognition in articles from the social sciences domain. Unsupervised methods are often based on lexicons or predefined rules. Thus, Etzioni et al. (2005) uses lists of patterns and domain-specific rules to extract named entities. Eftimov et al. (2017) developed a rule-based NER model to extract dietary information from scientific publications. Evaluation of the model performance showed good results. Opposed to previous unsupervised NER approaches, Iovine et al. (2022) proposed a cycle-consistency approach for NER (CycleNER). CycleNER is unsupervised and does not require parallel training data. The method showed 73% of supervised performance on CoNLL03. NER in scientometrics analysis Named entities are widely used in scientometrics analysis. Thus, Kenekayoro (2018) developed a supervised method for the automatic extraction of named entities from academic bibliographies. The aim of the study was to create a database containing unified academic information about individuals to help in expert finding.
