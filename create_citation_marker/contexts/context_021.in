Scientific influence refers to the productiveness and creativity of the researcher, while institutional influence is associated with the scholar’s administrative position in the scientific community. Wang and Shapira (2011) investigated the connection between research funding and the development of science and technology using acknowledgments from articles from the field of nanotechnology. Rose and Georg (2021) studied informal cooperation in academic research. The analysis revealed generational and gender differences in informal collaboration. The authors claim that information from informal collaboration networks makes better predictions of the academic impact of researchers and articles than information from co-author networks. Mejia and Kajikawa (2018) argued that the classification of funders could be useful in developing funding strategies for policymakers and funders. Doehne and Herfeld (2023) manually investigated acknowledgement sections of papers, which were published or preprinted in association with the Cowles Foundation between early 1940 and 1970 to trace the influence of the informal social structure and academic leaders on the early acceptance of scientific innovations. Blockmodelling was applied to the acknowledgement data. Their analysis showed that the adoption of scientific innovations was partly influenced by the social structure and by the scientific leaders at Cowles. Recent advances in NER Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a form of NLP that aims to extract named entities from unstructured text and classify them into predefined categories. A named entity is a real-world object that is important for understanding the text.
